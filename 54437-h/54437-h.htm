<span class="subhead">JEAN FRANÇOIS—JEAN FRANÇOIS</span></h2>

<p>The sea lay blue to the far horizon. Blue—Ah, blue is but
a name till you have seen the sea that breaks around the
Bahamas and gives anchorage to the tall ships at Port
Royal; that great sheet of blue water stretching from Cape
Catoche to the Windward Islands, and from Yucatan to
beyond the Bahamas, studded with banks and keys and
reefs, the old sea of the Buccaneers shot over with the
doings of Kidd and Singleton and Horne.</p>

<p>On the salt white sand in the blinding dazzle of sunlight
the waves were falling, clear-green, crystalline, each lovely
as a jewel. The crying of the gulls, loud all the morning,
had died down with high afternoon and high tide; the wind
had faded as though withered by the sun. Just at the
moment of high tide the sea makes a pause in its eternal
labour, the great act of systole has been accomplished and,
break the waves as they may, the profound languor of the
ocean makes itself heard and felt.</p>

<p>Gaspard Cadillac, ex-stoker of the <i>Rhone</i>, sitting with
his back against a palm tree cleaning an old tobacco pipe
and absorbed in the job, felt this pause and hold-up in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
nature just as the gulls felt it—just as much and just as
little as they.</p>

<p>“I have raised my horizon,” said the sea. “I have lifted
fleets towards heaven, hidden reefs; I have drained the
occidental shores and domed with water the Indies, I rest
from my labours and I dream.”</p>

<p>Our man beneath the tree was a Moco. The French
navy is divided into two great classes, the men from the
south and the men from the north, the Moco and the
Ponantaise.</p>

<p>Gaspard was a man from the south, a Provençal, dark,
handsome in a rough way, wiry and vivid. Yves, his bosom
companion, also a stoker of the <i>Rhone</i> and the only survivor
with Gaspard of the wreck of that ill-fated ship, was a
Ponantaise, a big man from Bretagne with a blond beard.
Yves was over away on the other side of the little island now
hunting for what he might find in the rock pools and creeks.
Away out there in a right line from where Gaspard was
sitting beneath the palm trees, under the blinding dazzle
of sea, the <i>Rhone</i> was lying with her bottom ripped
out, her boilers burst, her boats hanging smashed at her
davits; a horrible travesty of a ship, knocked under the
sea as if with the blow of a giant’s fist, a raffle of ropes,
machinery, and corpses.</p>

<p>The gods had been very good to Gaspard and Yves,
and Gaspard had, by the direction of the gods, been the salvation
of Yves. The whole catastrophe had come like a clap
of thunder on a moonlit sea. The “Haa-r <em>rip</em>” of the reef
that had been waiting a million years for the <i>Rhone</i>, the
screaming of scalding steam and scalded men, a wild bellow
from the siren, the roar of the boilers opening out, and the
shout of the lifting decks, all that, so thunderous and
apocalyptic, so full of tragedy, and torment, and woe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
filled the night for a moment for miles around, and then
there was nothing but the moonlit sea.</p>

<p>Yves was a good swimmer, but his heart had gone out
in him; he had been held down under water by the suck of
the sinking ship, and he would have drowned to a certainty
only for Gaspard, who was a bad swimmer but a
bad drowner.</p>

<p>The wiry Provençal, courageous as a rat, had held Yves’
head above water till Yves felt the sea slapping him in
the face and saw a great spar lifting and dripping in the
moonlight; saw Gaspard seize the spar, a picture almost
instantaneous, a picture that told him at once the truth
and made him strike out for safety.</p>

<p>The set of the current had carried the spar to the islet.
One might have fancied that the sea, repenting for that
sin of hers, had determined to save these two last survivors
of the <i>Rhone</i>. But the sea cared for the men as much
as she cared for the spar—less, for they were lighter.</p>

<p>Boxes and crates had come drifting ashore, getting caught
and tangled in the reef-mesh to eastward of the islet; a
horrible abundance of provisions, all sorts of articles from
the cargo, corpses, spars, everything yet nothing, pounding
about in the desolate reef-strewn water, made the east
side of the islet a place to avoid.</p>

<p>The two men in the few days since the wreck had salved
enough food to last them for months, there was a spring of
water amidst the low bay-cedar bushes that stretched from
shore edge to shore edge, the islet was in a trade track,
and they were certain of near rescue; all these circumstances
made them easy of mind and made a holiday of
the episode.</p>

<p>Gaspard having cleaned the pipe to his satisfaction,
filled it with tobacco and lit it. Then he lay on his back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
with his head in the scanty shade of the palm fronds, the
peak of his cap over his eyes, the smoke from his pipe
curling upwards in the windless air.</p>

<p>Windless for a moment only. The tide had turned and
with the turn of the tide a faint breathing shook the palm
tops against the blue. Maybe it was the breeze carrying
the voices nearer, but the crying of the gulls seemed to
louden with the turning tide.</p>

<p>The old interminable song of the French navy immortalized
by Loti sang in the ears of the Moco as he lay,
blissful, forgetful, seeing pictures, dreaming dreams.</p>

<p>Now he was in the stokehold of the <i>Rhone</i> feeding furnace
No. 2. He could feel the cotton waste protecting
his hands from the heat of the rake; he could hear the
clatter of the ash lift and the boom of the sea.</p>

<p>Hi! Hi! Hi! The weary, querulous call of the gulls
brought up the <i>Tamalpais</i>, a three-master in which he had
served for a voyage.</p>

<p>Hi! Hi! Hi! It was the very voices of the men hauling
on the halyards; he could see the topsails bellying to the
wind, the great sails held hard against the blue, the yards,
the studding sail booms; away from years ago and across
three thousand miles of sea came the voices of the men
hauling in chorus, echoes from the past answering the
lamentable crying of the gulls.</p>

<p>And now the <i>Tamalpais</i> went to pieces, became a curl
of smoke, vanished, and he was on the wharves of Marseilles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
in a bar standing before a zinc counter, a chopin
of wine, and a girl.</p>

<p>Ah! that was it, the girl; some piece of grit had been
irritating his mind for the last few minutes, something
behind his laziness and happiness had been working for
his discomfort; we all know that feeling when the subconscious
self is grumbling or worrying over something
that the conscious self has forgotten for a moment.</p>

<p>Anisette was the name she went by; a pale-faced, undersized
girl. You would not, possibly, have looked at her
twice, but had you done so you would, were you a man, certainly
have looked at her a third time.</p>

<p>She was of the type that appeals to a man’s passions,
never to his heart, and she stood at the bar of the Riga
where the Swedes and Norwegians congregate, and there
Yves and Gaspard had fallen in with her and she had
favoured Yves.</p>

<p>The big, blond Yves had captured this little pirate who
had sailed for years unharmed and harmful. She had
scorned Gaspard, who would have given his hand for a
glance from her, and she had given herself wholly to
Yves.</p>

<p>Had he loved the woman with a pure and simple love
Gaspard might have forgiven Yves, his bosom companion,
for the victory; his affection for Yves was one of those
brotherly loves that ennoble a man, and the Moco was
capable, perhaps, of a splendid abnegation. But Yves
had crossed him in his passions and the Moco was a man
who could never forgive that.</p>

<p>Hi! Hi! Hi!</p>

<p>Girl and bar and Riga tavern vanished, giving place to
Marseilles harbour, with the <i>Rhone</i> thrashing her way out.
A passenger had given Yves a cigar; it was always the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
way; Yves had all the luck; if there was a cigar or a drink
going it always fell to Yves—or a girl—yet he, Gaspard,
had saved this man’s life.</p>

<p>Now, on board ship, at work, all these grumblings would
have been there in the heart of Gaspard, but they would
have been undeveloped; here, in idleness, they grew; and
to visualize the awful power of woman it is enough to
make your mental standpoint the apex of a vast triangle
the other two angles of which are Anisette serving drinks
in the tobacco-smelling bar of the Riga and the Moco beneath
the palm trees warring in thought against his bosom
friend Yves.</p>

<p>A great crab fell with a thud on the sand beside Gaspard,
who sprang half erect to find himself face to face with
Yves.</p>

<p>The Ponantaise was laughing. He had caught the crab
amidst the rocks; he had two more under his arm, their
claws tied together with a string; he had found a boat sail
from the <i>Rhone</i> and a small spar, out of which he intended
to make a tent; he flung the lot on the sand and then sat
down beside his companion, took out his pipe, filled it, lit
it, and began to smoke.</p>

<p>The Moco, after his exclamation of surprise, had fallen
back in his old position, and the two men smoked without
interchanging a word.</p>

<p>They would go like this for a long time without speaking
a word. One might have fancied them enemies, or at least
put out at one another; not at all. They were simply
sharing the tremendous taciturnity of their species. All
who help in the labor of the sea share in its weariness,
<em>Vasta Silentio</em>, the motto, is written on the waves.</p>

<p>Hi! Hi! Hi!</p>

<p>The breeze had freshened a bit, giving life and energy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
to the calling of the gulls; the Moco, his pipe out, pushed
his cap back from his eyes and sat up.</p>

<p>“See here,” said Yves, “you know over there where I
fetched these things from—well—over there I’ve found
something.”</p>

<span class="subhead">A SECRET OF THE SEA</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Eh bien?”</p>

<p>The big Yves laughed in his beard and dug his naked
toes into the hot white sand luxuriously. Gaspard was
shod, for he had turned in all standing just before the
disaster to the ship; but Yves, more particular or less tired,
had kicked his shoes off.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Eh bien?</i>”</p>

<p>“Something funny, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mordieu!</i> Yes, when you see it
you’ll stare.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it? You keep on like an old woman; if
you found anything funnier than yourself it would be
queer.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, come and look and you will see.” Yves
rose to his feet, kicked the crabs into a heap, spread the
sail on the sand, and placing the crabs in the sail, made
a bundle of them; having tied the bundle with a rope he
placed it in the shadow of the palms.</p>

<p>“That will keep them safe till we come back,” said
Yves, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">allons</i>.”</p>

<p>He led the way right across the islet to the north.</p>

<p>It was scarcely a quarter of a mile wide, this islet, and
covered from shore edge to shore edge with thick bay-cedar
bushes rising to the knees. The only trees upon it were
the palms. Those seven palms gathered in the clump
beneath whose shade the Moco had been lying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
The breeze, which had freshened momentarily, had now
died again, and as they tramped through the dense growth
the sun, now passing into the western sky, struck them on
their left sides so that they could have sworn they were
walking side turned to an open furnace door. But they
were used to heat and neither of them grumbled, or only
occasionally the Moco.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a nice tramp to see something funny; it
seems to me the funny thing is that we should be sweating
ourselves like this; if you could shew me a decent bar at
the end of our journey—”</p>

<p>“Come on,” replied Yves; “you will not be sorry when
you see it.”</p>

<p>The sea to the eastward of the island was heavily sown
with reefs; the great reef that had destroyed the <i>Rhone</i> lay
due south; northward there were also reefs; only to the
west was the approach to the island safe.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said Yves, as he tramped his way out
of the bushes and on to the northern beach, the Moco
following.</p>

<p>Yes, there were reefs here, indeed, just a dark bloom
under the blue water, just a trace of snow; a pencilling of
foam shewed where the murderers of the sea lay hidden, and
the sea was beautiful here, more beautiful than to the
south of the island, for the reefs and the shallows were
continually changing in the wonderful light of the tropics
to suit the hour of the day; colours chasing colours, sky
blue parallels of sea and heather purple lines of reef greeting
the dawn, cornflower-coloured spaces of water flashing
the sky back like mirrors at noon, whilst at sunset, in
those wonderful sunsets that reach to the zenith, all this
stretch of sea and reef would be a field of beaten gold.</p>

<p>Just as the ever-changing light of day made ever-changing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
beauties, so did the ever-changing air, and ever-changing
tide; at low tide with a strong breeze every reef would
speak and you would hear a sound that once heard you
would never forget, the song of a hundred tiny shores, the
tune of the reefs. Sometimes in those great low tides
in which we fancy the moon and the sun hauling together
at the heavy blue robe of the sea, as if to make her shew
her hidden armour and her scars, the reefs would be fully
exposed, razor-edged, hungry, and lean. In these low tides
you would see great fish betrayed by the sea and trapped
in the pools, flinging themselves in the air like curved
silver swords. Conversely, in the great high tides you
might have sailed a battleship in fancy over the unclouded
water.</p>

<p>Yves, leaving the beach, began to clamber along a ledge
of rock that went straight out from the shore like a natural
pier; Gaspard followed him, treading the seaweed under
foot. There were no gulls here; the fishing ground of the
gulls lay to the southeast, but so small was the island that
you could still hear their voices on the air that had now
become absolutely windless.</p>

<p>The water lay deep and clear on the left of the ledge
of the rocks, but Gaspard had eyes for nothing but the
slippery seaweed under foot.</p>

<p>These reefs are as a rule so rough, so serrated with
keen-edged spines of coral, that bare-footed, as Yves was,
to walk on them would be impossible; but this great ledge
was comparatively smooth; it lay above high tide for the
first hundred yards or so, and then, shelving slightly, lost
itself at high tide beneath the water.</p>

<p>The tide since its turn had already fallen two feet and
the hidden part of the reef was beginning to shew. It was
plain to the eye that the whole reef formed the edge of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
immense bath-like basin, an elliptiform lagoon, the longest
diameter of which lay from north to south.</p>

<p>Yves led the way till they were fifty yards from the
shore; then he stopped, turned, and pointed into the green
clear water to the left.</p>

<p>The lagoon, unruffled by a breath of wind, lay lit to its
heart and burning like a vast and flawless emerald, its
floor of salt white sand, though invisible to the eye, was
still reached by the sun rays and flung them back
in a million sparkles that combined to form the water’s
dazzling soul.</p>

<p>Twenty feet out from the reef lay what seemed at first
a flat-topped, reed-grown rock; the tide was slowly uncovering
it and the ribbons of seaweed growing from it waved in
the aquamarine of the water as grass or land foliage waves
in a gentle wind. The rock, weed-grown and emerging
from the water, had for a base a column thicker than a
man’s body, a column here dazzling bright and flower coloured,
here dim and darkened with growing fucus; a column
whose lowermost part was lost in the vagueness of the
lagoon. The Moco, who had flung himself down and was
leaning over the reef ledge so as to see better, gave a
start. His sailor’s eye, after the first surprise, saw through
the mystery of the rock growing like a hideous flower on
a coloured stalk. The rock was the foretop of a ship, the
column was the coral-crusted mast.</p>

<p>But the mystery dispelled was as nothing to the mystery
half-unveiled. To the Moco, who combined in himself the
imagination of the southern man and the imagination of
the sailor, this hint of a ship in the still and silent water
appealed more forcibly than the full sight of a wreck on a
thunderous beach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
The coral-crusted mast led the eye down till the sight
found the pale, fish-like form of the ship itself.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Boufre</i>,” cried the Moco; “’tis as thick as a funnel.”
Then he was silent as was Yves, and lying side by side on
the grey dead coral of the reef, they contemplated the
column of living coral that once had formed the mast of
a ship.</p>

<p>The ship lay below unharmed as to her fore part, else
the mast would not have been left standing; driven years
ago by some great wave, she must have passed at one stride
of the sea over the circling reef of the lagoon, to sink,
the water pouring through her shattered timbers, and lie
lost here forever.</p>

<p>Or, in those past days there may have been a break in
the reef built up long ago by the restless coral. How she
had found her last resting place who could say; what had
been her business who could tell, but trumpets could not
have proclaimed doom and death more poignantly than did
the awful silence, the vagueness into which the mast sank
and wavered, towards the ghostly ship.</p>

<p>For eight feet or so below the foretop the mast was
dressed with seaweed, shewing only here and there the white
of the coral crust; below that the seaweed did not grow.
The eight feet indicated the rise and fall of the tide, for
the lagoon, though shewing no break in its encircling reef,
communicated through twenty unseen openings with the
outer sea and filled and emptied to high and low water
like a great cullender.</p>

<p>Flights of painted fishes flashed now and then through
the water and vanished, the seaweeds growing from the
mast shewed waving as if to a submarine wind, now like
dark brown ribbons of shadow, now like a drowned woman’s
hair powdered with sparkling blossoms; now a tress of vivid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
green would be loosened by the fingers of the outgoing tide,
catch a sunbeam and shew its beauty, or a tress of amber.</p>

<p>As they watched and as the tide sank lower, inch by
inch and foot by foot, the hidden portion of the mast
jewelled with coral and sea growths stole more clearly
into view, and foot by foot the seaweed portion beneath
the foretop stole from the water and stood dripping, dank,
and dismal in the sun, clearer and clearer like a grey cloud,
fish-shaped and enormous in the green below the lost ship
began to unveil herself to the sight. It was like the coming
of a ghost, a thing most dim yet wonderful to be seen.</p>

<p>One could trace the mast, now, right down to the deck.
It sprang from a coloured column from which here and there
grew great sea fans that seemed made from dark lace and
strewn here and there with all colours from the brilliant red
of tiny starfish to the delicate peach-bloom of the flat
lichen coral. So rich, so delicate, so opulent in colour, it
might have been the column of some fairy palace, this old
foremast of a forgotten ship.</p>

<p>The two men, taking comfortable positions on the reef,
had lit their pipes. Hour after hour they sat smoking,
interchanging a few words, but always with their eyes alive
for changes in the water below. Now forgetting to smoke,
they lay on their elbows looking down into the green depth
where, stronger through the shallowing water, sharper,
clearer, the ship began to shew her form hideous to the
sight as the form of a man bloated by disease; grey,
enormous, muffled with coral, tufted with what seemed
fungous growths.</p>

<p>“Look,” said Yves, pointing down to where the fantastically
high poop was humping itself into view, “saw you
ever a ship built in that fashion floating on the sea? Why
she is from the time of Noah—In the church at Paimpol<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
they have a model ship like that; she was dedicated to the
Virgin in the old days—”</p>

<p>“Let us look,” growled the Moco, speaking as if irritated
by the voice of his companion; then he hung silent, his eyes
fixed on the vision developing below. The tide had sunk
now to within a foot of low water mark, and as the veil
of water lessened so did the vision strengthen; one could
make out the decks clearly, all rough with coral, and the
coral banks that were once the bulwarks, a stump of mainmast
was left and had become converted into a cone of coral
the height of a man; trace of mizzen mast there was none.</p>

<span class="subhead">EVENING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>All this time, steadily as the tide, the sun had been sinking;
he had dropped through a dazzling azure sky and he
was now hanging almost in touch with the western horizon,
a ball of fire in a sky of dazzling gold; momently the gold
of the sunset took possession of the sky, spreading up, up,
till the very zenith was reached, and down, down, till the
gilding reached the eastern sky line. The world now
seemed clipped in the cup of a great golden flower, and the
little ripples that came sighing in round the low tide reefs
showed their foam like fleeces of gold. Not a trace of
cloud shewed in the golden sky, not a wave on the golden
sea; in that wonderful sunset the palm tops burned like
fingers of flame, and as music lights the soul of man, so
did the golden and glowing atmosphere the heart of the
lagoon.</p>

<p>The ship in the water below answered to the magic of
the light; the thing that had been grey and dismal as
death was in a moment transformed to a dream of colour,
the brains of frost-white coral became golden lamps; starfish,
sea-flowers, coraline growths, pink, crimson, indigo,
pale yellow, colour and form, all lent their adornment.</p>

<p>Shadowless on her bed of dazzling sand she hung for
a moment, burning in full sight, clear to the eye as though
she were floating in air and exquisite as a jewel, then just
as she had bloomed she faded out, her colour and beauty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
passing with the fading light, and as night swept over the
sea like the shadow of a violet-wing, she vanished utterly,
whilst the lagoon filled with darkness and the first stars
cast their shimmer on its surface.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Eh bien?</i>” said Yves, as he rose to his feet and stretched
himself. The Moco, who had also risen to his feet, looked
around him at the world of darkness that had displaced the
world of gold; he had seen many things, but nothing that
had ever struck his imagination so vividly as the sight now
veiled by darkness. His mind could not reason on the
question or refute by logic the feeling in his heart that
what he had seen was evil.</p>

<p>All that gaiety and colour decking the ruin of man’s
work was like laughter coming from under the seas.</p>

<p>Yves felt nothing of this.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the Moco, turning towards the shore, “let’s
go back.”</p>

<p>As they tramped their way through the brushwood they
talked of the thing they had seen. Yves thought that
from the height of her poop she must be very old, or it
might be that it was only a very big deck-house snowed
over with coral; he slapped his thigh as he walked, pleased
with the idea of the snow; when a boy in Brittany he had
seen things heaped with snow and bulked out in size, carts,
barrels, and so forth, just as the old ship was heaped and
bulked out with coral; but the simile was lost on Gaspard;
you do not get snow at Montpellier to any extent; also
his mind more trained by early education, and more supple
by heredity, refused to draw images from gross bulk; the
colours appealed to him; “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mordieu</i>,” said he, “she reminds
me most of a ship of flowers I once saw drawn along in the
carnival procession at Montpellier.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
“Flowers,” laughed Yves, “where would you get flowers
under the sea?” The stupidity of Yves roused Gaspard’s
ever-ready anger.</p>

<p>“From the devil, maybe—I was not talking of flowers
under the sea; I was talking of what I had seen in Montpellier.”</p>

<p>They had reached the southern beach, where the palm
trees grew, and Yves set about lighting a fire of dry brushwood;
when it was burning he heaped on some wreck-wood;
the ship of coral, the wreck of the <i>Rhone</i>, their position,
all were banished from his mind by the business in hand.</p>

<p>When supper was finished they sat each with his back
against a palm tree. The work of the day was over. They
had rigged up a rough sort of tent with the boat sail and
some broken spars, but the warm night held them in
the open.</p>

<p>The red light of the fire lit the white sand to within
a few yards of the sea edge, where the waves were falling
gently, rhythmically, drowsily, Haassh—Haassh—Haassh—a
chill and dreamy sound. Above, the sky solid with stars,
voiceless, windless, seemed a thing more alive and active
than the sea. From the slight elevation where they sat
a ghostly white streak on the starlit sea to the southward
indicated the reef that had slain the <i>Rhone</i>; only at low
tide and half way between flood and ebb tide did the snow
of the surf indicate the position of the murderer.</p>

<p>“She had a lot of gold in her for Havana,” said Yves,
breaking silence and nodding in the direction of the reef;
“seems a pity that it should be lying there under the sea
and no one to spend it.”</p>

<p>“See here,” said Gaspard, “it’s strange I was thinking
of that hooker lying in the lagoon over there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking, maybe, there is stuff worth looking for
a’board her if one could get at it.”</p>

<p>Yves laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you could get at it—if you could get at it—and
she built over with coral a foot thick; and if you could
break through it what would you find? dead men’s bones.
It’s like your flowers under the sea.” He tapped the dottle
out of his pipe, rose, stretched, and turned toward the
little tent, whilst Gaspard without a word continued smoking;
he could have struck Yves.</p>

<p>The son of a tradesman in Montpellier, he possessed
still some rudiments of the education he had received before
that fatal day when, driven by the instinct of wandering
and the hatred of restraint, he had run away to sea. Yves,
the son of long generations of sailors, had gone to sea as
a duckling goes to the pond. Gaspard had been taken
there by his imagination. He knew himself superior to
the lumbering Yves whose fingers were like fish-hooks, who
had the manners of a bear and the walk of a walrus, yet
Yves was always proving himself (by chance, no doubt)
the better and the luckier man.</p>

<p>He turned in under the shelter of the tent where Yves
was already snoring, and he slept and dreamt of the docks
of Marseilles, of Anisette, and of Yves.</p>

<p>From the salt-white sand of the beach to eastward, and some
two hundred yards from the palm-clump a ridge of coral
rocks ran out into the sea like a natural pier. The water
lay deep off these rocks and the fishing would have been
good had the ship-wrecked ones possessed lines and hooks.</p>

<p>Gaspard, next day, late in the afternoon was standing at
the end of this coral pier, the sea of an incredible blue, sailless,
forlorn, came glassing shoreward in long gentle lines
of swell, slobbering and sighing by the rocks and breaking
sadly on the sands.</p>

<p>When the sea comes in like this in long spaced undulations
a voice steals through her voice, the something tragic, the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quid obscurum</i> that hides in nature and speaks through the
elements and the passions is heard. The sea has a hundred
voices, Gaiety, Triumph, Strength, Sadness, Regret, the
wave speaks them all. But stand on a day like this on a
desolate island in the tropics and listen to the voice that
steals from all that splendour of light and gaiety of colour,
the violent heaving wastes of water, the triumphant sun, the
sky of living blue, through all these, from all these you will
hear a voice, it is borne by the languid voice of the sea.</p>

<p>It is the voice of Loneliness.</p>

<p>Loneliness—Fate, Death, Tragedy—all these are dwarfed
before her, to escape from whom the very atoms of matter
cling together, animals join in herds, men in communities.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
She who says to man “I walk by you from the cradle to the
grave, with me you go forth from the world alone, because
of me you work out your fate alone, by the shores and desolate
plains of the north I shew my face, by the tropic sea
men hear my voice. I am she who makes Death terrible. I
am she who makes Love beautiful. Love my only enemy.”</p>

<p>Gaspard, standing on the reef, heard the voice, his eyes
were fixed on the green water in the shadow of the rocks,
an albicore like a flashing sword had passed a moment
ago, now there was nothing to be seen but the crystalline
vagueness through which here and there floated a scrap
of fucus. Just in that second, held between the sound of
the sea and the mesmeric crystal of the water his mind
heard Loneliness speak. Just in that moment was borne
in on him dimly, and without awakening true comprehension,
the tragic fact of human isolation, the fact that
each man is on a desert island set round by the sea of life,
and that there alone he must work out his fate, unless
from some island in the distance Love should bring him
help.</p>

<p>The fact came to him as a sensation rather than a
thought, the grave harmonics of the sea had whispered to
him this eternal truth, the fact which is the master fact of
life.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from behind, as he stood there gazing into the
depths came a voice that made him turn. Yves far away
amidst the low bushes was beckoning and calling to him,
capering, gesticulating, flinging his arms about. Yves
seemed to have gone mad, and Gaspard, making along the
rocks, ran across the sand, and through the bushes towards
him.</p>

<p>Over the bushes the air was shaking with the heat, Yves
was much farther off than he had seemed from the rocks;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
he was almost at the centre of the islet, and now as Gaspard
made his way through the bushes he saw that his
companion held something in his hand.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, lazy bones,” cried Yves, “and see what I
have found.” He waved the thing in the air, it was a belt
with a brass buckle and a pouch attached to it. He was
laughing, one might have fancied that he had fallen on
some great, good fortune.</p>

<p>He had.</p>

<p>“Look,” cried Yves. He opened the pouch, it was filled
with big pieces of gold; they had been wrapped in oilskin,
he had flung the oilskin away and he stood with his two
great hands outspread clasping the pouch and the treasure
bursting from it.</p>

<p>Gaspard at the sight gave a cry that rang across the
islet and was answered by the ever-wheeling gulls.</p>

<p>“Gold!” cried Gaspard, seizing a piece from the hand of
Yves. He examined it, bit it, glanced at it again. He
seemed dazed and had the look of a man who, long a prisoner
in darkness, had been suddenly brought face to face
with a powerful light. The piece of gold was Spanish, a
piece of eight, heavy, and stamped with the stately effigies
of a vanished king.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Yves, taking the coin back from the hand
of Gaspard and replacing it in the pouch with the others.
“Look!” As he buckled the pouch he pointed with his
foot at something amidst the bushes. Just here the bushes
were thinner than elsewhere and here the ground was
raised in a little mound. Amidst the bushes, white and desolate,
lay some bones. They were strewn hither and thither.
One might have fancied that here once lay a skeleton, the
embers of a man that some wind had blown upon and
scattered. A skeleton, in fact, had once lain here, on or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
amongst the bushes, but so long ago that the bushes dying
and growing again had cast the fragments apart. The
skeleton of a man; the skull which Gaspard had picked up
and was now holding in his hand told that.</p>

<p>It was a strange skull, small and deformed, hideously
broad across the cheek-bones; the bones of the thigh easily
distinguished by even the untrained eyes of the sailors
were unequal in length, the shorter of them had been
injured or broken, for it shewed the thickening where
callus had formed.</p>

<p>“Pah!” cried Gaspard, flinging the skull down. “He
must have been a beauty whoever he was—and look.” He
picked up an old pistol-barrel, eaten away by rust, the
trigger plate thin as a leaf and crumbling like a withered
leaf to the touch lay near. Many, many years of exposure
it must have taken to eat the metal away like that. Yves
glanced at the thing without interest. “Come,” said he,
and turning, he led the way to the southern beach. Here
under the palm trees he sat down, opened the pouch, and
rattled the gold pieces on the sand between his outspread
legs.</p>

<p>Gaspard, who had followed him without a word, stood,
without a word, looking on.</p>

<p>Yves counted the pieces; there were twenty-one of them
and he was disappointed; there had seemed more. He
began to recount them. He had scarcely done so when
Gaspard broke silence.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Gaspard, “half of that falls to my
share; half of that belongs to me by all rights.”</p>

<p>Yves stopped his counting and looked up. It was the
tone of Gaspard’s voice rather than his words, perhaps,
that caused the expression upon his broad, sun-burnt face.
A heavy, unfriendly expression, such as the face of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
croupier might wear when some punter disputes the game.</p>

<p>“Yours?” said Yves, “and who found them?”</p>

<p>“That’s neither here nor there,” said the Moco, “you
found them, it is true, but it was only a question of luck.
I might have found them just as easily, and if I had I
would have gone shares.”</p>

<p>Yves knew this to be a fact. Gaspard was the soul of
generosity. Generosity was not predominant in the soul
of Yves. He was a good-hearted man, but the Breton
peasant was uppermost in his nature; he had made this
great haul of golden fish entirely with his own hand, and
now he was called upon by a man more generous than
himself to share it.</p>

<p>He said nothing for a moment, but went on counting the
pieces; then, as if addressing them, “Yes, it’s easy to
talk of luck—but would I have found them if I had been
lying lazy on the beach, or staring into the sea like some
people? No, I was hunting for dead brushwood, doing
something for my living, and I found them.”</p>

<p>“Then keep them,” cried Gaspard, and turning on his
heel he walked down to the sea edge. He walked for a
bit along the sand, then, with his arms folded, he stood
looking at the sea.</p>

<p>His mind had left the subject of the money and was
clinging to the true grievance he had against Yves. The
poisonous source of hatred. Anisette.</p>

<p>But the grievance of the money was there as well, and
all at once by some alchemy of Satan the hundred grudges
petty and large that he had against his companion joined
together and formed the figure of a monstrous Yves, a
creature he hated, and who, so the devil whispered,
hated him.</p>

<p>The sun was now near its setting, and as Gaspard stood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
there with arms folded looking at the sea, the eternal
crying of the gulls took on a new meaning; they were saying
a new word:</p>

<p>“Yves,—Yves,—Yves.”</p>

<p>It seemed as though the very gulls were mocking him.</p>

<p>“Yves,—Yves,—Yves.”</p>

<p>He turned and strode up the sand to where Yves was
sitting beneath the palm trees.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking now over Tampico way in a sky
of living gold, the western sea, leaping to meet him,
flashed his splendour to the very shores of the islet; each
flake of foam seemed a flake of primrose light and the
sands stretched like sands of gold by the shores of the
golden sea.</p>

<p>Gaspard came right up to Yves, the splendour of the
sunset on his face, his hands clenched in his pockets, his
lips dry.</p>

<p>“All the same,” said Gaspard, as though he were continuing
a conversation, “you are a thief, and a son of a
thief—more fool I to chum with a dog of a Ponantaise.”</p>

<p>Yves rose up; he was a slow man to wrath, but terrible
when roused. The belt and the pouch containing the
money were lying at his feet; he kicked them aside as he
faced the Moco.</p>

<p>“You say—”</p>

<p>“I say what I have said.”</p>

<p>“After the fashion of the monkeys,” replied Yves, “that
say what they have said all day long—<em>drop that!</em>”</p>

<p>The Moco had whipped the knife from the sheath in his
belt. Both men wore knives, but the Ponantaise had not
drawn his. He stood with his arms folded across his
immense chest, literally as though he were nursing his
wrath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
“It is well known,” said Yves, his eye on the knife,
“that a Moco and a woman can only fight with their claws
and tongue.”</p>

<p>Gaspard dropped the knife; then he stooped and picked
it up as if to replace it in his belt; he seemed half mad
with rage and not to know what he was doing.</p>

<p>That was the moment of his life; the next he might
have replaced the knife in its sheath and all would have
been well, had not Yves, whose anger had suddenly passed
from his control, spat at the Moco a word.</p>

<p>A word of one syllable, one of those dead rats of
language that these men fling at one another in jest, but
when spoken in anger are worse than a blow.</p>

<p>The Moco flung himself back as though a snake had
struck at him, then the knife in his hand flashed through
the air and Yves was on his back on the sand kicking and
coughing and whistling at the sky.</p>

<p>The knife had just touched the jugular vein in his
neck; the air rushing into the vein made the whistling
noise, but Gaspard knew nothing of this. He strode up
to the body of his companion with fists clenched, prepared
for battle, and certain that his antagonist would
spring to his feet and face him.</p>

<p>Then he saw that Yves was dying. Dying of nothing,
apparently, for the knife was on the sand almost unstained
and the stricken man shewed no wound to speak
of, just a scratch on the neck from which the black blood
oozed in froth.</p>

<p>Had Gaspard raised his eyes to the west he would have
seen that the great sun was now cut in half by the sea,
dying in a scene of splendour indescribable, but he saw
nothing, nothing, but the face of Yves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
For a moment he stood, the last fiery rays of the sun
casting his shadow far away along the sand. Then he
was kneeling by the body, shaking it by the arm, calling
upon it to wake up—to come to life!</p>

<span class="subhead">AMIDST THE BUSHES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>After the first outburst of raving, impetuous grief, the
grief of a child rather than the grief of a man, Gaspard
rose up from where he had cast himself down by Yves.
The sun had long passed from the sky and the star-smitten
sea came in smoothly, rhythmically, breaking in foam on
the starlit sands, and there on the sand lay Yves, listening
to what the sea was saying.</p>

<p>His great right fist, clenched, was lying on his breast;
one might have fancied that the meaning of it all and the
mystery of that sky so filled with fire and passionate life,
and those wastes of the ever-fretting sea, had been revealed
to him in one stupendous moment, that he had
struck himself on the breast in the stupefaction of wonder
that he was gazing and listening, motionless before the
revelation forevermore.</p>

<p>Yves from a common man had become at once and at a
stroke a part of the immensity and the wonder of the
night, the reachless stars and the fathomless sea; and, for
a moment, Gaspard, standing before the body of the man
he had slain, saw death as the prehistoric man saw it
before language had robbed thought of its freshness and
power. For a moment only, and then the stars became
the stars again, and the sea the sea, and the dead body of
Yves the body of a man he had slain in anger.</p>

<p>And now that his southern nature had spent itself in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
wild outburst of grief just as a child spends itself in an
outburst of weeping, thought came back.</p>

<p>Well, then?—whose fault was it?</p>

<p>The knife was flung with no intent to kill,—what right
had he to die of a scratch like that?—and then the vile
word—that was the last of a long series of injuries. And
bit by bit his mind went back counting up the score of
these “injuries,” right back to the tobacco-smelling bar of
the Riga and to Anisette as he had last seen her, with
her little grimy hand resting on the great hairy paw of
Yves. That remembrance like a hideous lamp lit up all
his grievances, enlarging them two-fold. No, he was not
to blame; he had not meant to kill, and if he had, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Dieu
de Dieu</i>, look at the provocation!</p>

<p>He stood for a moment, his chin resting in his hand,
his eyes on the body before him; then he turned and,
walking down to the sea-edge, dipped his hands and
washed his face in the foam. As he turned up the beach
again towards the trees, wiping his streaming face with the
sleeve of his coat, he felt as though all the occurrences
of the last few hours had happened years ago, so remote
did they seem for the moment. The sight of the body
lying there so still in the starlight brought him to a pause.
Grief rushed back on him, driving all little and evil things
from his mind. He stood looking at his handiwork. It
had been an accident; he had not meant to kill; he did not
even remember flinging the knife. The act had been automatic
and committed in blind rage—all the same, he had
killed Yves.</p>

<p>Then, loathing the business which had to be done, he
seized the body of his dead companion by the shoulders
and began to drag it towards the bushes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>As he stepped from the bushes, his task accomplished,
he cast his eyes over the beach. It lay white in the starlight,
and there was nothing now to tell of tragedy but
the knife lying there just as it had fallen after its murderous
work. He picked it up, dug it in the sand, and
replaced it in its sheath. The belt with the pouch of
money lay under the trees; he picked it up automatically
and, carrying it in his hand, turned to the little tent.</p>

<p>As he walked towards the tent two heavy hands seemed
pressing down on his shoulders; unutterable weariness
had suddenly fallen upon him, robbing him of mind and
almost of movement, so that when he reached the tent he
was staggering like a drunken man.</p>

<p>He crept under the shelter of the tent, and with the
belt and the money beside him fell into a profound and
dreamless sleep.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="subhead">ALONE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When he awoke it was full day and the sands beyond
the tent opening lay white and blazing in the sunlight down
to the blue, lazy sea.</p>

<p>He remembered everything at once. It would almost
have seemed that his mind behind the veil of sleep had
been reasoning the matter out, for he had awakened saying
to himself out loud, and as if he were continuing a conversation,
“Yes—and what is more, I saved his life.” He
crawled from the tent and stood erect beneath the palms.
The morning, warm, sweet, and sunlit, lay around him;
the sapphire sky and flashing sea; snow-white gulls and
snow-white sands. A hot, gentle wind was stirring the
palm fronds. He collected some dry brushwood for the
fire, lit it, and piled on some wood from the wreck. When
it was alight, flickering a hundred red tongues at the sun
and staining the blue air with smoke, Gaspard was brought
to his first pause. Of what use was the fire? He was
no good as a cook. Yves had been the cook; he had
cooked crabs, tinned meat, and what-not, using an old
tin for a billy; he was born for that sort of work and
could do anything practical he turned his hand to.</p>

<p>Yves had always done the cooking whilst Gaspard had
looked on. This fact struck Gaspard for the first time
now. It was as though the dead Yves was still proclaiming
his superiority. Yves had salved most of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
stores, Yves had hunted for dead brushwood, Yves had
found crabs, Yves had found the spring of water, Yves
had found the boat sail, Yves had built the tent, Yves had
found the ship of coral in the lagoon, Yves had found the
gold. Yves had done everything since their landing, and
he, Gaspard, had done nothing but smoke and dream.</p>

<p>Far from being a waster, he had, still, left everything
to the big blond man so full of energy and resource and
the joy of life; the southern laziness had held possession
of him. All the same, Yves had proved himself the
better man and was proving the fact now, voiceless and
dead amidst the bushes as he was.</p>

<p>Gaspard kicked the fire to pieces and flung sand on
the embers; then he breakfasted on some ship’s biscuit
and some tinned meat, lit his pipe and strolled down to
the sea-edge.</p>

<p>It was eight o’clock and the gasping warm wind came
in over the morning sea, the lazy, deep blue sea, so infinite,
so beautiful, so desolate.</p>

<p>He stood, and, shading his eyes, he swept the horizon—not
a trace of sail or smoke could he see. The sky, of a
burning emerald just above the sea-line, swept up into
the burning blue, and from sea and sky, like the breath
from a great blue mouth, came the warm wind. It felt
like a woman’s hot fingers playing with his hair, like a
woman’s warm arm cast round his neck.</p>

<p>From the southeast with the wind, now loud, now low,
came the crying of the gulls. Though he had heard them
since awakening, he had not noticed them till now; he
turned his eyes to where they were wheeling and flying
spirit-white in the blue.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Loneliness seized his heart.
The fact of his utter isolation had not stood before him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
full square till just now. The gulls were explaining it
to him.</p>

<p>“You are alone!—alone!—alone! Hi!—Hi!—Hi!—you
there on the sands alone!—alone!—alone!—we have nothing
to do with you—we are nothing to you—alone there on
the sands—all day long and night and day, and night and
day, who will you speak to—what will you do? You there
on the sands alone!—alone!—alone!”</p>

<p>He drew his sleeve across his brow to wipe away the
sweat that had suddenly started tingling through his skin;
then he cast his eyes again over the sailless blue of the
sea and, turning, came back to the tent. When he reached
it the terror left him, fell from him suddenly like a dropped
cloak. He cursed himself for his stupidity and, though
his pipe was not half exhausted, he tapped the tobacco
out, re-filled and lit it. It was something to do. Then,
to drive the thought of Yves away, he fell to imagining
what sort of a ship would take him off the island, and
then he stretched his hand into the tent and pulled out
the belt and pouch of money. On the brass buckle of
the belt, all green with verdigris, there was something
scratched. He cleaned the brass with sand—it was something
to do—and made out what seemed the initials “S.&nbsp;S.”
He pondered on these for a while and then, opening the
pouch, he turned the contents on to the sand.</p>

<p>Though he knew the number of coins, he counted them
again and again—it was something to do. Then he began
to spend them in fancy, the remembrance of the tragedy
of yesterday always standing like a ghost behind his
thoughts and trying to obtrude itself.</p>

<p>This occupation lasted him an hour, and he was brought
back from it suddenly by a tug at his heart. It was still
morning; the awful day had scarcely progressed; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
mantle of Loneliness had fallen on him again; the gulls
were still crying, calling, wheeling, rising, falling, fishing
mechanically and seeming part of a tireless mechanism
fretting the speechless blue of the sky.</p>

<p>He put the coins back in the pouch and flung belt and
pouch into the tent; then he rose to his feet and made
towards the bushes.</p>

<p>On the sand still lay a mark as though a heavy sack
had been dragged along it towards the bushes.</p>

<p>He avoided the pointing of the sinister path and struck
across the islet, crushing the brushwood under foot. He
had no object other than to get away from the place where
he was, to keep in motion—to be doing something. The
heat lay heavy over the bay cedars, the air was shaking
blanket-fashion under the fiery rays of the sun, the bushes
were dense, yet in a trice it seemed to him he had reached
the northern beach. The islet seemed to have led him
across it to explain its smallness, and as he stepped on to
the beach a new sensation caught him in its grip. The
sensation of being ringed in, enclosed in a small circle
from which there is no escape.</p>

<p>Yet there were no bars, and around him on every hand
stretched infinity.</p>

<p>He came along the reef forming the edge of the lagoon;
the tide was beginning to flood and the foretop of the
ship was standing stark and dry from the water; the ship
herself was clearly to be seen, in this light even more
clearly than in the sunset glow. But the picture was far
less beautiful.</p>

<p>Grey and dead she seemed, lying there in the diamond-clear
emerald of the water, but the lagoon this morning
was gay with fish, parrot-fish, gropers, flights of coloured
arrows, sapphire, ruby and emerald-tinted ghosts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
The swell of the incoming tide came slobbering over the
reef; shutting one’s eyes one might have fancied a giant
shuddering and catching his breath and sobbing to himself.</p>

<p>Gaspard stood for a long time watching the moving life
of the lagoon, absorbed, as a child might be before the
contents of an aquarium. He had forgotten Loneliness
for a moment, but she had not forgotten him. As he
stood with his eyes fixed on a large fish, sapphire and
mist-grey, that had developed like a spirit and was now
hanging motionless with moving gills above the ship,
casting a vague shadow upon the coral-crusted deck; as he
stood watching it, the breeze strengthened, stirring his
hair, and on the breeze a voice hailed him, far away and
weary.</p>

<p>“Hi! Hi! Hi!—you there on the reef. Hi! Hi! Hi!—you
there alone!—alone!—alone!—see how the wind takes
us, wheeling, fishing, forever—alone—alone—alone.”</p>

<p>He turned his face to where, across the islet, far away
in the blue, the gulls’ white wings were winking and beckoning
to him; their voices, thinned by distance, had a
desolation rendered even more desolate by the gorgeour
of the burning blue sky, the triumphant sunlight, the licking
of the warm weak wind.</p>

<p>There is no desolation so terrible as the desolation that
lies in summer warmth and blue skies. Here life ought
to have been superabundant, but here there was no life
or moving thing save the wind and the gulls and the waves.</p>

<p>“God!” said the Moco. He thrust his clenched fist in
his pocket and, turning from the lagoon, made his way
along the rocks to the shore.</p>

<p>He returned to the south of the islet, not through the
bushes, but along the eastern sea-edge where the reefs were
like rows of teeth and the rock edges like razors. Here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
it was that most of the wreckage of the <i>Rhone</i> had come
ashore, and here there was still wreckage enough, in all
truth. Here was something to do.</p>

<p>In a moment he was up to his knees in water. The
<i>Rhone</i>, when the explosion of the boilers rent her asunder,
had cast wreckage enough upon the water, but even still,
as she lay beneath the surface, sinking more and more
completely to ruin, things were breaking loose from her
and rising as bubbles rise from a submerged body, and
drifting ashore with the tide. Hencoops, boxes, spars,
barrels, were pounding about in the surf. Heavy spars
were here, all chawn and frayed by the reefs; the coral
teeth had left their marks on everything; there was nothing
worth salving, yet Gaspard worked like a dock labourer,
hauling upon spars, heaving at barrels, forgetting
Loneliness in the exertion of manual labour.</p>

<p>But she was there, and her voice forever speaking, subtle,
like a music interpenetrating all things from the sound
of the wave to the silence of the sky, made itself heard
again.</p>

<p>As the power of friction brings a machine to a pause,
so did this voice, which was a part of the sunlight, a
part of the silence, a part of the blueness of sea and sky,
bring Gaspard to a stand.</p>

<p>He wiped his brow and looked at the heap of things he
had collected. He remembered how Yves had laboured at
the same job, and now, for the first time since the tragedy,
as he stood looking at the heap of spars and wreckwood,
a feeling of pity came to his heart for the man lying there
dead amidst the bay-cedar bushes.</p>

<p>The outburst of grief to which he had given way on
the evening before was, to speak truth, an outpouring of
his southern nature; anger suddenly checked and flung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
back by Death, inverted and bursting forth furiously at
the sight of the irreparable result of his anger.</p>

<p>But this feeling of pity for Yves came from the depths
of his soul, for it was born of pity for himself.</p>

<p>It was fatal for this feeling to enter his heart just now,
for the heart, softening towards the dead, opened the door
for superstition to enter.</p>

<p>He thought of the tent over there beneath the palms
and how pleasant it would be if, on his return, he were
to find Yves sitting by the tent. Then, with a chill of
horror, came the idea—how awful it would be if on his
return he were to find Yves sitting by the tent! His
imaginative mind played with this idea for a moment and
then cast it hurriedly away. He laughed out loud to reassure
himself, and the steady wash of the sea made answer
and the distant gulls. Then, leaving the salvage bleaching
in the burning sunlight, he came towards the southern
beach.</p>

<p>No; there was nobody by the tent, but the wind was
playing with a loose corner of the sail-cloth, flapping it
about. The tent seemed beckoning to him as he came
towards it across the white, blazing sands. Everything—every
sound, every gesture of animate or inanimate nature,
was beginning to have a deep and extraordinary significance
for Gaspard. The silence, the sunlight, and the blueness
had first conspired to shew him his loneliness; the
gulls had insisted on it, gloated over it, explained it; but
now, since over there by the wreckwood the pity for Yves
and his fate had entered into his heart, the gulls, the
silence, the sunlight, and the blueness were speaking a
language less assured. “Are you alone? Hi! you there
on the sands, what’s that beckoning to you? Hi! Hi! The
wind flaps the tent? Ha! ha! Hi!”—and then silence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
for a moment, and then, weak, weary, querulous, from
the circling white spirits away there in the smoky blue of
midday—“Yves—Yves—Yves.”</p>

<p>The very poetry of Loneliness, Distance, Blueness, Regret—fatal
regret.</p>

<p>Gaspard fastened up the flap, and the wind, as if
vexed at being robbed of its plaything, shook the palm
fronds, and then some of the finest of the sand on the
beach gathered itself up into a little sand devil and danced
away on the wind. An unseen hand seemed moving everywhere
fitfully, now here, now there, touching the sand,
touching the trees, touching the bay-cedar bushes.
Gaspard, as he lay with his head in the shade of the tent
resting after his exertion, listened to the faint patter of
the palm fronds and the whisper of the sand; sometimes
the sail-cloth of the tent would lift a bit to the wind.</p>

<p>It was only the wind, yet it moved like a living thing.
Sometimes he imagined a hand lifting the tent-cloth back
and a voice saying, “Hullo! what are you doing here?”
He imagined Yves as the possessor of the voice, and he
drove the imagination from his mind.</p>

<p>Never for a moment did he feel fear of the body lying
away there amidst the bushes; not for the worth of the
<i>Rhone</i> would he have gone through the bushes to look at
it and see how it was faring at the hands of corruption,
yet he felt no fear of it; on the contrary, it was the thing
he dwelt on when he wished to allay fear. For fear,
faint and indefinable, was taking hold upon him now. He
had no compunction about the part he had played in the
death of Yves. The thing was an accident, so he told
himself; all the same, men who die suddenly and violently
have a habit of haunting the place where they die.</p>

<p>You can run from a haunted house, but you cannot run<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
from a haunted island. This dread of no escape was what
formed the true basis of his fear, a thing on which to build
terrible and fantastic edifices. He lit a pipe and, smoking
it, he fell asleep, awakening in an hour or so refreshed and
fearless. Sleep seemed to have wiped away Loneliness,
superstition, and all their attendant evils. He felt hungry,
and getting some tinned meat and biscuit from the store of
provisions which lay close to the trees he dined after a
fashion, and then lit a pipe.</p>

<p>It was now half-past three, the gulls had ceased crying
and afternoon lay on the island like a hot, heavy hand. So
still seemed everything that one might have fancied the
islet wrapped in idyllic peace; but it was the peace that
broods over fermentation. The air over the sands was
shaking in waves and a faint hum of insect life came from
the bushes. A torrid and tremendous pyramid of light
stood upon nature, crushing her to silence yet unable to
stifle her faint fret and murmur.</p>

<p>At four o’clock Gaspard was standing at the end of the
little pier of coral reef just at the place where he had been
standing yesterday, when Yves’ voice had called him to
see the treasure. There were no fish visible in the water
to-day, nothing floated there but an occasional scrap of
seaweed. The clear water, bright as a diamond and
green as an emerald, held the gaze with the fascination
that lies in a globe of crystal. Out here at the end of the
projecting spur of reef, with the sea on either side, one felt
as though one were standing on the deck of a boat.</p>

<p>It was pleasant out here with the sea coming in gently
around the rocks, leaving scarcely a trace of foam, scarcely
a trace of sound; the islet was singing to the little waves,
but the reef only gurgled, slobbered slightly when a higher
ridge of swell lapped the more exposed portions, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
sighed as the water sinking exposed the weeds, the clinging
shells, and the coralline growths.</p>

<p>Gaspard, standing, looking into the green depths, mesmerized
by their crystal clearness and thinking of nothing,
was suddenly brought to consciousness by the feeling that
someone was standing close behind him. He wheeled
round. Nothing. The reef, the islet, sea and sky were
destitute of life, yet distinctly he had felt as though someone
were standing behind him, almost in touch with him,
almost breathing upon his neck; and he felt that if he had
turned more sharply he would have caught sight of the
viewless one; and the reef, the islet, sea and sky, had for a
moment a simpering look, as though they had succeeded
in the trick of snatching the Unseen One away before he
could be glimpsed.</p>

<p>The absurdity of this idea destroyed it almost as soon as
it was born. He shook the sensation off with a little shiver
and, casting his eyes over the sea-line again as if in search
for a ship, he began to walk along the reef back to the
shore.</p>

<p>He was stepping from the reef on to the sand, when
upon the sand he saw something that brought his breathing
to a stop. The imprint of a naked foot.</p>

<p>It was a foot-mark left by Yves, and there was nothing
supernatural about it at all; it had been left on the previous
day, and it was still sharp and clear, for a ledge of the
reef had protected it from the wind and the blowing sand;
but to Gaspard it was more terrible than the naked face of
Death.</p>

<p>He walked away from the terrible thing with his hand
clutching at his heart, his eyes cast from side to side, not
daring to look back. He did not know where he was going,
but his feet led him to the palm clump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Here he sat down with his back to a tree bole. The
terror was behind him and the tree seemed to fend it off.
The tree was a living thing; all at once it had stepped out
of the semi-inanimate world where trees dwell and flowers,
and had become a living personality. In his supreme terror
he could have turned and embraced it, but he was
afraid for a moment to move from his position, just as a
man is afraid to move who, attacked by enemies, has his
back to a wall.</p>

<p>Such terror does not last in its entirety for more than a
brief space of time. Reason came to his assistance. He
remembered that Yves had been by the reef end on the
day before. The foot-mark was a real thing. No ghost
could have left it.</p>

<p>He was telling himself this when,</p>

<p>“Hi! Hi! Hi!”</p>

<p>Loud, shrill, heart-snatching came a hail right from
behind him. It was the voice of Yves, and springing to
his feet with a scream, Gaspard, clinging to the tree-bole,
looked.</p>

<p>A great black man-o’-war bird with bright eyes and
coral-red beak was passing over the islet and hailing it as
it passed.</p>

<p>Tremendous, definite, and strong against the blue, yet
more soundless in flight than an arrow, it passed overhead
without a motion of the wings.</p>

<p>As it passed it hailed the island once again, and once
again from far out at sea, motionless, but fast dwindling
till it became a faint speck and was lost in the blue to
southward.</p>

<p>Gaspard, breathing freely again, watched the great bird
losing itself in nothingness, lifting veil after veil of sky,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
and horizon after horizon of sea, bound for some port of
call in the Windwards or beyond.</p>

<p>The shock had been better than medicine to him, shewing
him his own superstition and the stupidity of his alarm.
The island seemed suddenly freed from the haunting presence;
he began to doubt himself. If a bird could make a
fool of him like that, he must be a fool indeed.</p>

<p>A year seemed to have passed since sunrise and the
sun was now dropping to the sea, bringing to its end that
vast blue day so filled with loneliness and the terrors of
the unknown.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BOAT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Most of us have never known the day as it is and the night
as it is. Protected from the wind and the sunlight by
walls and houses, by artificial light from the darkness, by
words from the truth, we have created an artificial world
in the midst of the true world. In the wind, in the sunlight,
in the sea, there are voices speaking a language long
forgotten; lost when thought, becoming vocal, set up a
language of its own and a tower of Babel in the world of
dreams. Even still, when alone in the solitudes, on the
moors, on the mountains, by the sea, through all the claptrap
of language and thought come the voices; the true,
eternal voices that were before we were and will be when
we are not.</p>

<p>Voices of which all art, in marble, in tone, or in words, is
but the pathetic imitation, an echo dulled and muffled and
debased. In this lies the eternal despair of art.</p>

<p>To the mind of the commonest man, if he be imaginative,
the language of the eternal things is louder far than to
the mind of the most cultivated man if he be only imitative.</p>

<p>Gaspard’s mind was of the imaginative order. Up to
this, in the forecastle or stokehold, on board ship or on
shore, he had been held apart by his fellows or protected
by the common things from the eternal truths. Loneliness
in her extremest form had brought him in touch with them;
or at least within whispering distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
The great blue day, dying now, had searched his heart
and mind; it was as though the old gods of nature had
landed on the island and stood around him viewless and
perplexing him with whispers. Fear, Air, Distance, Light,
and Sea had spoken to him in turn and in chorus; Loneliness
had echoed what they said.</p>

<p>There was something more in the wind and the sun and
the sky and the sea than he had known of up to this; the
drinking-bar, the forecastle, the sailors’ lodging-house,
those black holes had hidden him from this knowledge; a
debased language in which the word “sea” stood for
wharves and ships, stokeholds and furnaces, decks and
glimpses of ocean had paralysed his thought and numbed
it. Twelve hours of loneliness and fear, face to face with
nature, had loosened the old false labels from the truths
of things and, without a glimpse of the real truths, a dim
recognition of the falsities unsettled his mind.</p>

<p>The damning mesmerism of language had suspended
itself partly for a moment in this partly unsophisticated
mind, and as he sat watching the sun sink in the western
sea, the word “sunset” or the word “sea” never occurred to
him. He was thinking without language, lost in contemplation,
like an animal viewing from a distance a new and curious
but undisturbing phenomenon.</p>

<p>And the sight was tremendous as ten million cubic leagues
of golden air could make it. Fire, Light, and Distance
were there at this marriage of sun and ocean; colour, size,
limit, all were banished from the infinite, indefinite universe
of gold through which the golden sun was sinking
to the golden sea.</p>

<p>The sun had almost reached the sea-line and for a moment
Ocean and Sun hung apart, the splendour of the sea
answering the splendour of the sky. For a moment time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
seemed to cease and silence supreme, everlasting, golden,
and beautiful, held the West in her keeping.</p>

<p>A moment—and then, flashing, palpitating, leaping like
a woman under a burning kiss, the great sea flung her arms
up to her lover.</p>

<p>Destroying him utterly and almost in a moment, washing
him away, melting him as though he who had been fire
had become wax and the wax had been cast into a cauldron
of boiling gold. Then, as if millions of infinitely tenuous
golden veils were being stripped away with the rapidity
of thought, bluer and bluer, darker and darker, appeared
the night behind them.</p>

<p>A hand seemed sprinkling and spraying the sky with
stars.</p>

<p>One could scarcely say, “It is night,” before night had
taken possession of the world and the night-wind was
blowing in the palms.</p>

<p>Gaspard, rising, stretched himself and then crept under
the shelter of the tent; the opiate of the sea air and his
weariness brought sleep at once, profound, dreamless sleep
which lasted till just before dawn.</p>

<p>He was awakened by a sound.</p>

<p>Someone close to the tent had, so it seemed to him, struck
a single blow on a drum. He raised himself on his arm;
sleep had fallen from him like a cloak, and his mind was
alert again, and alive to fear.</p>

<p>He listened, but heard nothing except the weary washing
sound of the waves on the beach.</p>

<p>Then, as he listened, it came again, but from a distance.
Boom! A monstrous sound in that desolate place, alarming
and uncanny as the sound of a trumpet.</p>

<p>If it were a drum note, then, judging by the sound, the
drum must be of Gargantuan size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
With the sweat running from his face he crept out from
under the tent and stood beneath the trees.</p>

<p>Nothing. The new moon had risen and was floating like
a little silver boat amidst the stars; the starlight flooded
the sea and brimmed over on to the foam. So solid was the
sky with stars that the palm fronds cut their silhouettes on
it sharply and distinctly. Never was there a more lovely
southern night.</p>

<p>As he stood and listened, again, from very far away this
time, came the sound.</p>

<p>Boom! As though the drummer had stridden away
leagues across the sea to beat his drum around the world
before dawn.</p>

<p>Had Gaspard known these waters the sound would have
had less terror for him. It was the sound of great devil-fish,
sea-bats that rise from the water, quiver for a moment
in the air, and then fall, smashing the waves to foam, with
a noise that reverberates for miles. But he knew nothing
of the sea-bats, and he stood pursuing in his mind the
drummer who had beaten this strange <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">réveil</i> and with his
eyes fixed on the horizon to eastward where the sky was
stained by the dawn.</p>

<p>It came, killing the stars, clear and cold in tint, beneath
a sky shifting in colour from smoke-grey to aquamarine
and icy blue. Then it bloomed into warmth and kindness
of tone. Just as children hold buttercups to one another’s
faces to see the yellow reflection, so one might suppose
some hand beneath the horizon was holding a vast buttercup
to the dawn’s pallid face.</p>

<p>A thread of living gold stole along the sea-line, became
a fiery, moving caterpillar, and, at a stroke, the last stars
were washed away, dissolving in blueness and infinite distance,
the sun was peeping across the water and then suddenly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
as though he had taken a leap elbow-high and elbow
resting on the sea-line, he leaned forward and struck the
world in the face with his great golden hand.</p>

<p>Had you been watching Gaspard, as he stood with the
dawn wind blowing his hair, you would have seen the stroke
of the sun’s hand on his face, on the palms behind him, on
the sea before him, suddenly given as a blow.</p>

<p>The same hand was striking the Bahamas, and in a hundred
blue harbours from Cape Sable to Port of Spain
ships’ topmasts were catching the light. Martinique, Guadeloupe,
Grenada, peak, morne, and valley, were already
flaming to it like green torches in the dawn wind. Key
West would be stricken in a moment and the gulf to Galveston
and Tampico be turned from a lake of stars to a
living sapphire, the Caribbean would leap alive from Grand
Cayman to Darien, from San Juan to La Guaira, alive and
burning and blue. The wind that was blowing in Gaspard’s
face, a wind that came over the blue and laughter of the
morning sea like a wind from the golden age and the youth
of the world, held freshness for the orange groves and the
gardens of all these Western islands where the night jessamines
were closing, the night insects ceasing their songs,
and the fireflies preparing to put out their lamps.</p>

<p>Gaspard knew nothing of that tremendous poem in colour
which the dawn shows to God each time she lifts the
darkness from the tropics; just now he did not even see
the sunrise and its splendour, he had, for a moment, forgotten
even his fears; his eyes were fixed on an object
about a mile away to the southeast, something round and
black that bobbed in the sparkle and glitter of the water.</p>

<p>It was like the head of a swimmer, and now it was like a
drifting buoy. It was drawing nearer, the current was setting
it towards the island, and now—it was like a boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
It was a boat!</p>

<p>There could be no mistake; it underwent alterations of
shape as it twisted to the slap of the waves, now head on
for the island, now nearly broadside on.</p>

<p>A boat—release from the islet and its dreams and terrors!
The cry that escaped from Gaspard seemed echoed
by the gulls.</p>

<p>He made for the pier of coral reef, running along the
sand to it, forgetful of everything, never glancing at the
place where the footsteps of Yves had been, scrambling
over the coral till he reached the extreme end, where, surrounded
by the morning sea, and the wind, and the light,
he shaded his eyes and watched.</p>

<p>The boat was now plainly in view dancing on the waves
with the lightness of a walnut shell on the ripple of a pond.
It was empty and drifting towards the islet, but it would
not touch the beach, it would pass by a few hundred yards;
he saw that, and he prepared for the event by casting off
his clothes.</p>

<p>It seemed a small boat midway between a dinghy and a
ship’s quarterboat, and never to Gaspard’s eyes had anything
appeared so gay in motion or so friendly as this tiny
craft dancing upon the waves.</p>

<p>At a distance it had seemed black, but now he saw that
it was painted white; it was clinker built, for, so clear was
the air, he could see the overlapping planks, and now as
he stood preparing to take to the water and swim to it, the
terror of the islet which he had shaken off for a moment
came behind him again, and at once held him back and
urged him forward.</p>

<p>What if the Terror followed him into the sea? Behind
him there seemed a deadly enemy filled with wrath at his
attempt to escape, and, for a moment, the want of power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
that comes to us in nightmare held him shivering in the
wind, the next he was in the sea, striking out for the boat.</p>

<p>He had to swim against the current that was carrying
it, the waves hit him in the face like wet hands trying to
drive him back; but the shock of the plunge had given him
his courage.</p>

<p>The boat was close now, beautiful and buoyant, and
white as a gull, smacking the sea as she came, shining with
spray, the green water under her showing clear as an emerald.
Now, she was only an arm’s length away, and now,
he was grasping the starboard thwart. She heeled over
slightly as he got his elbow on the thwart and peeped in.
She was empty of everything but the bottom boards and a
pair of sculls, clean scoured with spray; a dead flying-fish
was lying washing about in the few inches of water she
had shipped; it was newly dead and had struck her only
perhaps an hour ago.</p>

<p>He worked his way round to the stern, boarded her and
stood upright.</p>

<p>He was free of the island at last, but he would have to
land to get his clothes and some provisions and water.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="subhead">THE ESCAPE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>He stood for a moment balancing himself, his eyes sweeping
the sky-line to southward, which shewed neither sail
nor stain of smoke, and as he stood he heard the island
calling to him.</p>

<p>“Hi! Hi! Hi! you there in the boat! come back! come
back! Hi! Think you to escape us? Ha! ha!—hi! Fishing,
wheeling, calling, O the weariness, the blueness, the
waves, the wind, the sun; they are ours and they are yours,
forever—forever—forever. Hi!”</p>

<p>Through the voices of the gulls came the monotonous
tune of the beach across the bright morning sea. The tent
flap had got loose again and was beckoning. Come what
might, provisions and water must be taken on board and
the clothes he had left on the reef spar recovered.</p>

<p>He felt like a man who had just escaped from a haunted
house, yet he had to go back. To land again on that terrible
spot and leave the boat whilst he hunted for the things
was an act requiring real courage, but it had to be done.</p>

<p>He got the sculls out and, rowing towards the strand,
beached the boat cleverly. There was no danger in leaving
her, as the tide was ebbing; the only danger was in delay,
for if the water receded too far, he would not be able to get
her afloat again till high tide.</p>

<p>Jumping out knee-deep, he hauled her nose a little
higher on the sand, then, running like a man pursued, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
made for the tent, seized the belt and the pouch of money,
made for the heap of provisions, seized a bag of biscuits
and some tinned stuff, and with his arms filled returned to
the boat.</p>

<p>It was a nightmare business, for the vague fears of yesterday
had become more definite, as though the near chance
of escape had given them life. He felt Yves behind him
as he ran, sweating as he ran, from the boat to the store of
provisions and back to the boat. An empty water-breaker
from the <i>Rhone</i> lay near the tent. This had to be filled;
the spring was amidst the bushes, yet he made his way
there, crushing the brushwood under his naked feet, his
breath coming in bursts, his lips dry as sandstone. Yves
had not caught him yet, as, the breaker on his shoulder,
he came running back to the boat. He flung it in; the
clothes, now, had to be fetched, the worst part of the business,
for it was fifty yards down the beach to the ridge of
reef and the clothes were at the extremity of the reef. But
it had to be done, and he ran, sweating yet shivering,
worked up to the wildest pitch of excitement, by the sea
edge to the shore end of the reef.</p>

<p>He was without his boots,—he had forgotten that,—and
the reef was sharp and rough; there were edges like
knives that had to be avoided, drive Fear as she might.
This was the place where Yves had first stood behind him
in imagination, and it was here, now, that the pursuing
terror was most acute.</p>

<p>At last, bleeding, panting, with shaking hands, he reached
the clothes. He put on the boots and with the coat, shirt,
and trousers under his left arm, came back swiftly along
the reef, sprang on to the sand, and, running, shouting,
gesticulating with his free arm, made for the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
He was shouting at the boat; she was there safe enough
and in full sight; yet viewless hands seemed preparing to
push her off; she would be gone before he reached her, the
island would never let him escape.</p>

<p>When he reached her he brought his open hand bang
down on the gunwale as if to make sure she was really
there, flung in the clothes and then tried to push her off.</p>

<p>The tide had ebbed more quickly than he had imagined.
She was firm on the sand. It was a two men’s business to
float her and he never would have done it, had he been
alone; but he was not alone. Fear was with him.</p>

<p>The boat gave to his efforts, shifting slightly, then more
and more, till she moved stem and stern to the lifting
waves and was afloat.</p>

<p>He tumbled into her and she came broadside on to the
strand; but the waves were less than two feet high and
with one of the sculls he managed to pole her out, then,
seizing both sculls, he rowed.</p>

<p>He was free of the island at last; sculls and current
were sweeping him from it into the wastes of the blue sea;
the water, all merry with the breeze, smacked the boat
cheerily and flashed away and away, in the level sunlight
to where the palms were waving, and the foam was breaking,
and the sea gulls calling.</p>

<p>“Come back!—come back!—you are leaving us, but our
voices are following you. Go far as you may, our voices
will follow you, our weariness, the sunlight, the blueness
shall be yours forever—you there in the boat alone, where
is Yves—Yves—Yves?”</p>

<p>Then, more far away, the last word, the last echo from
the island,</p>

<p>“Yves—Yves—Yves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Now, there was nothing but the passing of the wind, the
sound of the sculls, and the warbling of the water. There
were no waves here, the shallows and the reefs had made
the sea choppy close to the island; here there was nothing
but a heave of the sea, long lapses of swell, infinitely blue,
breeze-strewn and sun-dazzled.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />

<span class="subhead">A STAR ON THE SEA</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The island had passed away, painted out by distance; the
sky above the horizon, paled by the indigo of the sea, lay
like a ring of sparkling emerald; to southward, where the
emerald passed into the living burning sapphire of the sky,
lay a line of white clouds, swan-white and like a flock of
flying swans, darkening with their suggestion of snow the
blueness of the water, deepening with their remoteness the
distance.</p>

<p>The warm wind blew steadily sparkling up the blue,
the incredible blue of the sea; the scull-blades, immersed
half a foot in the water, were tinted with azure, the floating
scraps of seaweed were tinted with indigo; a man floating
a yard deep would have shewn like a form of lazulite.</p>

<p>Gaspard had drawn in his sculls; free of the island now,
what use was there in rowing? He had no idea of direction,
North, South, East or West. His only chance, so he
told himself, lay in his sighting a ship. He was in the
hands of chance and he did not feel afraid. Not only that,
but he felt in his mind a certainty that before long he would
be rescued.</p>

<p>The relief of his escape from the island may have had
something to do with this intuitive optimism, and the fact
that he had provisions and water enough to last him for
days. Loneliness had vanished; he had left her behind
on the island, she and Yves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
It seemed like a bad dream, all that, and Yves was the
worst part of it. He felt neither sorrow nor compunction
for what had happened. Why should he? He had not
meant to kill, and if he had meant to kill, would he not
have been justified? He felt nothing of remorse, nothing
of that pity for the dead man which had come to him yesterday,
when, standing by the reefs on the eastward of the
island, he had looked at the heap of raffle he had salved.
He had suffered too much since then to have any sentimental
feelings on the matter. Haunted and bedevilled,
he had escaped with his reason more by luck than anything
else.</p>

<p>He dressed himself and then he sat, rocked by the swell,
drifting, the sun rising higher towards the zenith, the wind
blowing steadily out of the southeast, warm as a woman’s
breath. Every now and then a flying-fish like a silver
arrowhead would leave the sea, flash through the air, and
vanish.</p>

<p>Towards noon a shoal of them chased by some enemy
broke the water to starboard; one passed right over the
boat, soundless in flight, swift, brilliant against the blue,
with staring sightless eyes; a phantom from the deep pursued
by a phantom, definite for a moment and hard to the
sight as a jewel, gone like a ghost the moment after, made
one again with the blue sea.</p>

<p>The wind tempered the heat of the sun, long strips of
seaweed floated past lazily, and a turtle that had been
sunning itself basking on the water’s surface, slipped
away and vanished as the boat drew near. A great gull
came along drifting on the wind, passed with the silence of a
moving cloud and dwindled to nothingness in the blue to
northward.</p>

<p>Nothing in the world of water and sky seemed to move<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
with effort, a profound languor filled it all from the depths
below to the heights above, from the little boat whispering
and chuckling on the ripples to the distances of the horizon;
distances that shewed nothing, told of nothing but summer,
vagueness, and azure.</p>

<p>Two hours before sunset Gaspard standing up to get a
better horizon and shading his eyes with his hand saw,
away on the eastern sea line, a bright point burning like a
star.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="subhead">LIKE A THIEF IN THE NIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was a sail.</p>

<p>He stood with his eyes still shaded, motionless but for
the movement of the boat.</p>

<p>From away out there a hand seemed to have reached
clutching at his heart. The star so steadfast and so still
held him by its very stillness and steadfastness. There,
where the sunlight showed that motionless point of light
were crowded decks, bending spars, snoring sails, life,
motion; a ship breasting her way through the blue sea,
heeling to the breeze.</p>

<p>All that was there. Here, nothing but a star marking
poignantly the vacancy of illimitable distance. The wind
had freshened, it was as though the ship had sent the joyous
breath of life before her, the breezed-up water smacked
the boat merrily, and even as he looked the star grew, lifting
steadily as the mainsails joined the topsails above the
sea line.</p>

<p>As Gaspard watched, his confidence and assurance left
him. The blind trust in chance that had possessed him all
day vanished now that chance had shewn her hand.</p>

<p>At once and vividly his true position stood before him,
and the horrible chances of death that lay in it, and, so
strange a thing is mind, now and for the first time did the
sense of his own wealth in the possession of these twenty-one
big pieces of gold take possession of him. Side by side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
with the fear of not being rescued stood the vision of the
possibilities that lay in them. Each one weighed as much
as three twenty-franc pieces. Six hundred and three
francs; with that what might he not do! It was the only
big bit of luck that had ever fallen in his way, and it
would be doubly bitter to die with his luck in his hands.</p>

<p>And, still, as he watched, the sail grew. The vessel
was not nearly so far off as she appeared; for the boat gave
a low horizon. For this reason, too, she seemed bigger
than she really was. That she was heading straight for
the boat he could not doubt, yet he stood torn by the fear
that she would miss him, pass him by, not sight him.</p>

<p>His imaginative mind saw her passing, saw her fading
away, saw himself standing and calling after her and
cursing her; so vivid was the obsession that for a moment,
as he drew the picture, blazing wrath shot up in his heart
towards her captain, curses rose to his lips, and sweat
started on his brow.</p>

<p>Then he wiped his face with his coat sleeve, and unable
to remain in idleness a moment longer, took the sculls and
headed the boat for the point from which the vessel was
approaching.</p>

<p>Useless, the moment his back was turned on the sail it
was gone from his mind as from his sight. He had to keep
it in view and shifting his position with the sculls half
drawn in, he sat watching.</p>

<p>He had not so good an horizon sitting as standing, yet
the sail had sensibly increased in size even allowing for
the altered elevation.</p>

<p>With a dip of the sculls he kept the boat so that he was
always facing the approaching vision, and sitting thus the
picture before him resolved itself into three components:
the after part of the boat, white, clean-scoured by spray,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
and burning in the sun with the exception of the space
covered by his shadow; the blue of sea and sky; the ship.</p>

<p>Seated, with the sculls ready to correct the boat when
she twisted to the wind and the current, his eyes passed
from the boat to the far-off ship, from the ship to the sea
and sky.</p>

<p>And still she grew, as a child grows in the womb, as an
idea in the mind, adding member to member, significance
to significance. He could see now the fore topsail distinct
from the fore course. She was a square rigged vessel as
to the fore part, but coming as she was, the spread of fore
and topsails screened her rig.</p>

<p>She had altered, too, in colour; the frost white star was
now a truncated pyramid of pale but brilliant rose, around
which the deep blue heart of the sky paled to emerald by
contrast.</p>

<p>And still she grew, motionless, or seeming not to move,
yet becoming more definite, expanding as a bud expands,
voiceless, and like a vision developing in a dream.</p>

<p>Moment joined itself to moment, minute to minute. She
might now be ten miles away, or maybe more, her course
would bring her directly to the boat and she would sight
it to a certainty <em>if she had light</em>.</p>

<p>It was his own shadow cast by the oblique rays of the
sun on seat and bottom board and thwart that suggested
the chilling clause.</p>

<p>The sun was little more than an hour from his setting;
would he cut the sea line before the vessel sighted the boat?</p>

<p>It was a race between the sun and the ship. He knew
quite well that though she was coming apparently dead on
to him, the chances were that she might pass him by a
considerable distance, and, as though the thought had cast
a blight on her, for a long time she hung, not seeming to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
alter in size. Then magically, she took distinctness, mystery
and beauty left her; in a short half hour she became
clearly defined, a small vessel of perhaps two hundred tons,
at a distance of perhaps five miles. She would not be
doing more than eight or nine knots.</p>

<p>Gaspard looked behind him at the sun. It had outraced
the ship, there were still diameters between it and the horizon,
but the western blue was just beginning to turn, to
tinge with vague orange, as though an impalpable mist of
gold dust were rising from the sea.</p>

<p>But now the ship, as a runner strains when near the
goal, seemed straining to reach him. Moment by moment
she leapt nearer, and the old stained sails that had lost
the vague rose of distance caught now the first touch of
gold from the sunset.</p>

<p>The eastern sky still held its blue, and against it the
ship burned like a ship of gold, and before her prow the
water divided like glittering silk cut by a golden sword.</p>

<p>Scarcely a mile away she leapt more triumphantly into
life, she seemed within hail; standing up and stripping off
his coat Gaspard waved it, shouting against the wind,
delirious, forgetful of distance, forgetful of the sun and
then—just as though a bad wizard had touched her she
began to lose her brilliancy; she had seemed springing
towards him with golden arms outspread, triumphant, and
seeking to save him and then, just as though indifference
had suddenly seized her, she seemed to lose her speed.</p>

<p>He turned his head. God! the sun was gone, just a trace
of fire lingered beneath the gold of the sunset, through
which, like a dark blue wind, was stealing the night.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The vessel from a ship had turned to a phantom lost in
a world of violent shadow. With the passing of the sun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the breeze fell away to a gentle breathing of air. Then,
in that moment of darkness and indecision, before the stars
have taken full possession of the sky, standing up and
straining his eyes he could not see the ship at all.</p>

<p>Ah! here she came at last, stealing along in the starlight
with sails just filling and, then, more clearly to view as
ten million stars lit the sea, turning it to frosted silver.</p>

<p>At four knots without a light showing, softly and seeming
the very embodiment of treachery and evasion she came.
She would pass by some five cable lengths to starboard and
Gaspard, seizing the sculls turned the boat’s head to cut
her off.</p>

<p>As he rowed he shouted, and had anyone on board heard
him they might have fancied it, so thin and hard was his
voice, the crying of a sea gull, but from all appearances no
one heard him, for not a light shewed.</p>

<p>Now she bulked up enormous, a great trapezium of ebony
cutting the silver sky; he ceased rowing, shouted again, and
paused to listen. So close was she that he could hear the
wash of the water at her fore foot, the creaking of blocks
and the slatting of the scarcely filled sails.</p>

<p>Scarcely a cable length away and making to pass him by
half that distance she came, black as ebony, a barquentine,
silent as a phantom, stealthy as a thief. Then, as he hailed
her again with a last despairing cry, she burst into voice.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<span class="subhead">CAPTAIN SAGESSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A lantern shot its light over the port quarter, a voice
hailed him from the deck:</p>

<p>“Hi yi ow!” shrill as a bird, and at the cry, like a shaken
beehive, the forecastle broke into life; the decks in a moment
were a-swarm, chattering like a tree full of monkeys,
another lantern shewed over the port bow, and above the
lantern a face black as the face of a devil with glittering
eyeballs and white teeth grinned down on the boat below.</p>

<p>Next moment something struck Gaspard across the chest,
it was a rope; seizing it he held on, and the little boat came
up grinding against the great washing wall of the vessel,
carried with her on her slow way and right beneath the
broad channel of the foremast. He seized the rope’s end
to the forward seat, caught up the belt with the pouch of
gold and fastened it to his waist; then, reaching up, he
caught hold of a channelplate and with the help of another
rope flung by the chattering crowd above, swung himself
on to the channel. Next moment he was on deck.</p>

<p>The starlight lit the decks dimly fore and aft, he was
surrounded with negroes swarming and chattering like
monkeys; a man in a panama hat who had helped him over
the side, and who, disregarding him, was now shouting
directions in shrill French to a black man who had slipped
down into the boat, seemed the only white man on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Having finished his directions he turned, kicked a negro
who stood in his way, caught up a lantern, and coming up
to Gaspard held the light to him as if he were a work of
art he wished to examine.</p>

<p>“French?” said the man in the panama, speaking in that
language and fixing Gaspard with a pair of beady unwinking
black eyes. His face lit up by the lantern-light was
round, good-tempered looking, the face of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon bourgeois</i>—yet
the eyes chilled Gaspard for a moment ere he replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, French, shipwrecked and floating about in that
cursed boat till you nearly ran me down.”</p>

<p>“What ship?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Rhone</i> of the <i>Compagnie Transatlantique</i>.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Rhone</i>; I have seen her in Havana harbour, is she
lost then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ripped her bottom out on a reef and gone with all
on board.”</p>

<p>“You are the only one saved?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Boufre</i>!” said the other, betraying his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">provence</i> in the
word. “A Moco, too, so was I till I became a man of my
own. Well I have saved you, and <em>I take the boat</em>! I am
Captain Sagesse, and this is my barque <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>.”</p>

<p>He seized Gaspard by the coat lapel as he brought the
words out with emphasis.</p>

<p>“The boat is mine, you understand.”</p>

<p>“Oh the boat, she is yours and welcome.”</p>

<p>“She is worth five hundred francs, and a brush full of
white paint will take the <i>Rhone’s</i> name off her. I found
you on a raft—no, on a hencoop—no, on a spar—” he slipped
his arm through Gaspard’s and was leading him aft to
the deck-house on the poop. “You were floating on a spar.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Here is the deck-house. Come in.” He opened the deck-house
door disclosing a cabin comfortably, yet roughly
furnished. A table stood in the middle, over the table hung
a swinging lamp. Two doors opening aft gave entrance to
the captain and mate’s cabins, tiny holes not much bigger
than dog-kennels. The captain flung his panama on the
table and Gaspard took a seat, and looked at his companion
who was now opening a locker, and fetching out a bottle of
rum and some glasses and a basket of ship biscuits. This
roundfaced and contented looking personage had, in the
first moment of their acquaintance, invented and asked him
to assist in a microscopic felony. He placed his hand on
the bag of gold at his side as, leaning on the table, he
replied:</p>

<p>“But, see here, that boat doesn’t belong to the <i>Rhone</i>
at all.”</p>

<p>The man in the panama had placed the things on the
table, he turned.</p>

<p>“But you said—”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you have not heard all; I was wrecked from
the <i>Rhone</i> right enough, on a spar too, away on an island
down there, then the boat came floating along, she has no
name on her that I have seen, I got into her and rowed
away—that’s all.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Outre</i>,” said Sagesse, pouring out two glasses of rum,
whilst Gaspard took a biscuit. The little man almost seemed
disappointed; one might have fancied that he regretted
the lost chance of “doing” the <i>Compagnie Transatlantique</i>
out of a boat, then he took a Martinique cigar from his
pocket, lit it, and with his elbows on the table began to
talk and ask questions.</p>

<p>He asked questions without waiting for an answer, nay,
he sometimes answered them himself, <span class="locked">as—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
“The <i>Rhone</i>, I have seen her in Havana harbour, what
tonnage was she? Oh, I know, seven thousand; she and the
<i>Roxelane</i> were sister ships. The <i>Roxelane</i> called regularly
at St. Pierre. Oh, yes, I ought to know her, Martinique
bred as I am. Not born, mind you. No, I was born at
Arles, but I have spent thirty years in these seas. One
can make money in these seas, but one never can forget
the old land, and you were born at Montpellier, you say, ’tis
the same thing, and all Provençals are brothers. Think
you, if I picked up a Dutchlander or an English, or even a
Ponantaise, I would be giving him rum in my cabin—”
Then mellowed by the rum and the presence of another
Provençal, he leaned his elbows further on the table and
continued talking and asking questions without seeming
to hear the answer.</p>

<span class="subhead">RUM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>He had done big things, had Captain Sagesse, since the
day thirty years and more ago when, deserting from a
French ship, he had taken up his abode at St. Pierre. Beginning
at the very bottom, he had worked his way up to
comparative affluence, and whilst plying Gaspard with
questions he interpolated fragments of his own history.
Captain Sagesse was the only subject of very deep interest
to Captain Sagesse; had he been going to his own execution
he would have cast fragments of his history to the crowd,
he was a walking autobiography, and he had been closed for
three weeks, inasmuch as the crew consisting entirely of
blacks, he had no one to open himself to. He told of how
he worked the vessel entirely with blacks, Barbadians, and
when he had exhausted his slight interest in Gaspard
and his history he returned to himself, talking as though
Gaspard were an old friend just stepped aboard, the freemasonry
of the south and a common birthplace giving him
the familiarity of long acquaintanceship. There was
scarcely a disreputable transaction in which a ship’s keel
could find a place but it seemed that Captain Sagesse and
his barque, the <i>Belle Arlésienne</i>, had been in it—gun running
in the Spanish-American war, smuggling, and worse.
He owned the vessel, he owned property in Martinique and
very questionable property in St. Pierre; and inspired now
by rum and what seemed at first blush a charming and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
natural naïveté, he told about himself and his doings, his
possessions and aspirations with characteristic force and
freedom.</p>

<p>Gaspard, at first half drowsy with weariness, listened
like a person in a dream to the chatter of the other, then,
the rum beginning to take effect upon him, he found himself
laughing at things which might have made him frown
if listened to in strict sobriety. He was sinner enough, but
in his small way in life he had dealt straightly with his
fellows, he had, at all events, no feeling for a scoundrel,
and Captain Sagesse was scoundrel enough, heaven knows,
to judge by his conversation. He had got the better of
governments, men, and women; he gave neither names nor
dates nor places, talking in his loose way with nothing
more definite than, “It was an islet, it might have been
fifty miles south or fifty miles north of Rum Cay—but
that doesn’t matter,” or “Honorine, that might have been
her name, but it wasn’t, anyhow, I’ll tell you the trick she
served Pierre Sagesse, and then I’ll tell you the trick he
served her.”</p>

<p>All at once the brain of Gaspard, drowsed by the events
of the day, cleared, perception became acute, sensation
beatified, two glasses of strong rum and the Martinique
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bout</i> which the Captain had given him, had opened for him
the door of the Brandy Paradise; the deck-house of <i>La
Belle Arlésienne</i> seemed palatial, Sagesse the greatest of
men and he, Gaspard Cadillac, the equal of Sagesse.</p>

<p>He held out his glass for more rum.</p>

<p>“And mark you,” said Sagesse as he poured it out, “I
got my hold on her in that way, because, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mordieu</i>, I remembered
those two words she said that night to the mate of the
<i>Bayonnaise</i>. They thought I was drunk, but I have never
been drunk in my life, and I never forget.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
“Nor I,” said Gaspard, “never been drunk and never
forget.” The recollection of Anisette and Yves came up in
his mind, and he thumped the table with his fist. “I have
served my man out. No, I never forget. Now you listen—”
But Sagesse was off on another tack, money business this
time, and Gaspard rocking unsteadily in his seat with his
eyes injected, the cigar in the corner of his mouth, and his
fists clenched on the table before him, sat hearing nothing,
glorified in the hideous upset of alcohol, filled with the
splendour of his own importance, and tormented on his
throne by something, he knew not what, but which took
the form of Yves.</p>

<p>It was the woman of Marseilles still working like a
demon at his heart and brought into full life by the drink.
The feeling that another man had done him out. That
another man had been preferred to him. That another man
was a better animal, even though that man was dead.
Alcohol told him that he was glorious, supreme, a man
amongst men. Anisette like a pale, sneering ghost said
“Pshaw. Where is Yves. <em>You</em>, you are nothing to a
woman.”</p>

<p>“And it was worth seven thousand dollars American
gold coin,” Sagesse was saying in the course of his yarn,
when Gaspard, whipping the belt and pouch from his
waist, brought them down on the table with a bang, so that
the gold coins rolled out.</p>

<p>“Look at that,” cried Gaspard. “What you say?
Wasn’t that worth the thrust of a knife?” The coins
danced before him as he sat rocking in his seat, an abstemious
man as a rule, the weariness and the strong old
rum had done their work.</p>

<p>Sagesse stopped short in his story, stared at the belt and
the gold and then at the man before him. Sagesse, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
he chattered of his own doings, never by any chance gave
a man a handle to use against him; his tales were as vague,
all save the villainy of them, as clouds; his one weakness
was talking and he knew it and guarded against it, the
villainies he boasted of were all apocryphal; based they
were on black deeds, just as clouds are based on mountains,
the scoundrel in him had to boast, but to bring Sagesse
to book on one of his stories would be like attempting to
bring a bird to earth by grasping at its shadow on the
ground.</p>

<p>Men had tried to blackmail this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">raconteur</i> on the
strength of his statements; to bring the vulture to earth
by catching at his shadow, only to find themselves in the
vulture’s clutch, blackmailed themselves most cruelly. And
he never let go as long as his clutch held, and there was a
feather on the victim. But though he chattered fables, he
knew when to be silent in face of facts. He was silent now.
He laughed but said nothing for a moment, whilst Gaspard
gathering the coins together in a heap, reiterated his
question.</p>

<p>“What you say—isn’t that worth the thrust of a knife?—given
in fair fight, mind you, man to man, and the better
man wins.” Sagesse held out his hand, took a coin, examined
it and handed it back.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bon Dieu</i>, yes. So you killed him—but where did he
get these things from, they are not coins of to-day. Had
he, then, been robbing a museum?”</p>

<p>Gaspard nodded with drunken gravity.</p>

<p>“That’s it, you’ve hit it, he robbed someone of them and
wouldn’t share, it was over there on the island.”</p>

<p>“Aha,” said Sagesse. “So you killed him on the island,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vé</i>, but you are a man after my own heart, the island—and
the name of your man you said was—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
“Yves.”</p>

<p>Gaspard exhausted, falling into the third stage of intoxication,
was leaning now over the table, his eyelids drooping,
the cigar end, no longer alight, held loosely in his
nerveless fingers.</p>

<p>“Yves—and what rating was he?”</p>

<p>“Stoker.”</p>

<p>“So—but he had another name, he was not only called
Yves?”</p>

<p>“What you say?” asked Gaspard, rousing slightly.</p>

<p>Sagesse repeated his question, but the man at the table
did not seem to comprehend, then, stricken with sleep he
sank completely forward, his head resting right cheek down
on the table, his right hand on the pouch containing the
money. Sagesse looked at him for a moment contemplatively,
then he went to the door and cried, “Jules.” A
shuffling sound came along the deck, and a big negro, bare-footed
and bare-breasted, with his wool all tied up in little
knots, made his appearance at the door.</p>

<p>Sagesse pointed to the man at the table, and Jules with
a broad grin but without a word, entered and took the
dreamer by the shoulders, Sagesse took him by the feet,
and between them they carried him to the starboard dog
hole, which did duty for a mate’s cabin when a mate was
on board. Here they put him in the bunk, Sagesse placed
the belt and pouch of money in the bunk beside him, then
they closed the door on him and left him to his slumbers.</p>

<p>When Sagesse found himself alone, he took a chart from
a locker, spread it on the table and pored over it.</p>

<p>Gaspard had told him that he had only been drifting
since morning. If this were so, if the man were not lying,
and if, indeed, he had left an island that morning, then the
only island he possibly could have left was here marked on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the chart, a tiny island reef beset to North, South, and East;
eighty miles or so southeast of Turks Island.</p>

<p>Sagesse knew the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic that
includes the Bahamas as well, almost, as he knew the heart
of the lower order of mankind. He knew from his own
knowledge, and leaving the chart aside, that there was only
one islet about here from which a boat could drift or be
rowed in the course of a day to the point where he had
picked up his new acquaintance. He knew the island by
sight, too, the clump of seven palm trees, the white sandy
beach, and the murderous reefs. He had seen it through
the glass several times, in past years. He had counted
the palms, seven of them. He never forgot anything; that
was partly why from a foremast hand in the French mercantile
marine, he had risen to wealth and eminence of a
sort. He fetched a pen and inkhorn from the locker, and
made just over the islet the form of a tiny cross, then he
put the chart, pen and ink back in their places and came
on deck.</p>

<p>The moon had risen, still a crescent but strong enough
to flood the sea with light. Jules had relieved the man at
the wheel, and stood a dusky ghost before the yellow binnacle
light, the wind still held and had even strengthened
a little, and in the silence of the night the click of the rudder
chain, the wash of the water at the bow, and the
occasional groan of hemp-rope and block could be heard.</p>

<p>The barquentine seemed talking to herself in an undertone.
Old and weary of the sea, dressed in canvas, patched
and stained and ill-fitting, barnacled and streaming southern
weeds from her copper, she went her way across the
moonlit water, steering now, to make the passage between
Haiti and Porto Rico; a hag of the ocean groping her way
from port to port, now on honest business, now on contraband,
from Yucatan to Port of Spain.</p>

<span class="subhead">LA BELLE ARLÉSIENNE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>At about six o’clock the next morning Gaspard awoke from
sleep, half stifled by the close air of the little cabin where
Sagesse had placed him. The taste of the rum was still
in his mouth, and at a stroke, and almost at the return of
consciousness, the doings of the past night rose before him—up
to a certain point. He remembered the conversation
of Sagesse, he remembered taking the belt from his waist
and flinging it and the pouch of money on the table, but
beyond that point he remembered nothing.</p>

<p>He put his hand to his waist, belt and bag were gone.
He put his legs out of the bunk, and was just in the act
of getting on his feet when his hand rested on something
hard, it was the pouch. It had not been tampered with,
he could tell that by the feel, but, to make sure, he opened
it and counted the gold pieces by the dim light which shone
through the scuttle overhead.</p>

<p>Yes, the twenty-one pieces of gold were there, solid,
bright and hard. He put the belt round his waist and
buttoning his coat over the pouch came on deck.</p>

<p><i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>, close hauled under all sail, was
making a full eight knots steering S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. with the coast
of Haiti a line on the southern horizon. She had altered
her course in the night and she lay now with the shoals
and reefs south of Turks Island on her port quarter, but
nothing of them shewed, for the sea over that way under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
the newborn sun lay like a blazing gem, a sheet of corrugated
crystal, each of whose million, million facets was a
mirror; then, round from there to where the bowsprit was
poking at the sky above the sea line went the sea, without
sail or sign of life deepening in blueness to where the far-off
Haitian coast lay hyacinth coloured in the morning.</p>

<p>Gaspard looked around him, he could see no sign of
Sagesse; a negro dressed in a pair of canvas trousers held
by a single suspender, stood at the wheel, several more
were grouped round the fo’csle-head engaged on some
business, and a thin streak of smoke from the caboose told
of breakfast in progress.</p>

<p>From where he stood the deck stretched away unencumbered
by cargo, and barred by the shadows of the standing
rigging; they had taken the boat on board, and she was
lying bottom up on the deck forward of the mainmast.</p>

<p>Despite her age, despite the decks so yellow stained by
time that plank and dowel were of the same colour and
indistinguishable, despite the sails all cut and patched,
the old barquentine had still a look of buoyancy and life
caught from the brave morning light and the flooding azure
of sea and sky.</p>

<p>The smell of tar and bilge and rope, the groan of rubber
and creak of mast brought up for Gaspard the vision of
the <i>Tamalpais</i> and his early youth. No other sensation
is at all like the feel of a sailing ship beneath one’s feet.
The steamer is a dead weight driven by an alien force, its
progression is a continual insult to the wind and the sea,
but the sailing ship is one with the sea and the wind, her
motion is fluent, fresh, and part of the eternal movement
of nature. As Gaspard stood with his eyes fixed on the
distant Haitian coast, Sagesse came out of the deck-house
and gave him good-morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
The Captain had a telescope in his hand, and ranging
himself beside Gaspard he began to examine the coast-line
attentively through the glass.</p>

<p>Not a word did he say of the proceedings of the past
night. He stood picking out the points and headlands of
the coast, remarking on them now and then, and now and
then throwing in some piece of reminiscence, as “Over there—you
can just see that bluish spot, it goes in deep, the
land there—that’s where a big English ship went on the
rocks. The <i>Severn</i> in the storm of ’82. I helped in the
salving. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ma foi</i>, I have never seen such a big ship with
her back so broken. She was opened out like a band-box.
She was filled with millinery, too. New York fashions for
Jamaica; the rocks were dressed in chiffon, it was like the
wreck of the <i>Bon Marché</i>, and the negresses came down to
help—you can fancy!” or “That point, you can just see it
with the eye to eastward of the blue spot, over there they
hanged the last of the pirates, Freemantle—”</p>

<p>“What does he know, what did I say last night. I remember
flinging the money on the table, I remember
saying something about Yves—but what? Did I
say much, did I say little? And the money, he must have
picked it up and put it in the pouch, and put the pouch
and belt beside me as I lay in the bunk, hog that I was—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mordieu</i>—what
did I say?” These thoughts were running
through Gaspard’s mind as he stood watching his companion
and listening to his remarks almost without comprehending
them.</p>

<p>But Sagesse, whatever he knew, shewed nothing of his
knowledge. He chatted familiarly and easily, and when
breakfast was brought aft by Jules they sat down to it,
and over the steaming coffee and fried bacon and bananas,
the Captain continued his easygoing discourse, chatting on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
everything and nothing, but always with interest.</p>

<p>The blackguardly edge had gone off his conversation, it
was only at night it appeared whetted by alcohol, for
Sagesse was a methodical drinker, never glancing at the
bottle till the absinthe hour.</p>

<p>Gaspard during the meal made an offer of work, but
Sagesse would not hear of it.</p>

<p>“You are a brother Provençal, well, I have picked you
up floating about on the sea and that’s all about it, I have
more than enough hands to work the ship, and your food,
what does it cost? Besides, we can settle up at St. Pierre.
St. Pierre, Martinique, yes that is my port. You have
never been there? Ah, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mordieu</i>, then you have never seen
life, you will see it at St. Pierre where men know how to
laugh, and love is as cheap as bananas.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will be able to pay you,” said Gaspard, “that
is to say if I ever can pay you for all you have done for
me.”</p>

<p>Sagesse laughed.</p>

<p>His face, ordinarily pleasant except for a certain fixity
of the eyes, lost its pleasantness in some strange way when
he laughed.</p>

<p>Clean shaved, except for a rather heavy and drooping
moustache, fat and weather-tanned, in white cap and apron,
save for his bronzing he would have made an ideal chef;
a concocter of sauces and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entremets</i>, fat with the steam of
his kitchen; but when he laughed he shewed his teeth and
just that one touch destroyed his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonhommie</i>, for his
laughter did not extend above his mouth, and laughter is
inhuman when the eyes do not correct the teeth.</p>

<p>All day they kept the Haitian coast on the distant horizon,
the water had been blue off the island, but to Gaspard,
as he hung over the side, it seemed that this water was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
even bluer. It was; the Caribbean, that great lake of
burning indigo, was sending its colour to meet them, the
foam flakes from the fore-foot of the <i>Belle Arlésienne</i>
swept past like marble shavings cast on slabs of lapis-lazuli,
and violets would have seemed pale and faded held
against the background of the sea to southward.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MONEY-CHANGER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Gaspard, though a man full-grown and a man, moreover,
who had passed his life in touch with the brutal side of
things, had still in his nature very much of the child. The
Provençal rarely grows old, he withers at last in the sun
and comes to die, but the child in him remains a child;
imaginative, impulsive, easily moved to laughter or tears,
good or naughty, with a passion for colour, and movement,
and sound, and exaggeration. And so he remains a poet in
his way.</p>

<p>Go all over the earth, and you will find man imitating
the insect in this particular, that he is the colour of the
leaf he was born on. Gaspard was the colour of Provence,
and all the coal-dust of the stokehold, the sordidness of the
life had not altered his essential colour; the something
tragic, something gay, something vivacious, something lazy
which is part of the southern land of black shadows, white
roads, blue skies, keen mistral, and poignantly scented
flowers still clung to his personality.</p>

<p>Even Sagesse shewed something of a trace of this in the
exaggeration of his own doings, in his vivacity, and in the
flower which he carried in his button-hole when ashore.</p>

<p>But there was little of the child about Sagesse and much
of the master. As day followed day, and the working of
the vessel shewed itself more and more to Gaspard, astonishment
filled him at the extraordinary discipline amidst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
the hands, and the way Sagesse worked them. When he
was out of sight they would shout and chatter amongst
themselves, but the instant he appeared silence took the
deck as it takes a grove of chattering birds when a hawk
appears in the sky overhead. Orders were executed at a
run, yet he never swore or raised his voice louder than was
necessary; occasionally when a man got in the way, as on
the night of Gaspard’s boarding the vessel, he would give
him a kick just as a master might kick a dog, but beyond
that his rule seemed kindly. They were all Barbadians,
these blacks, and English-speaking, with the exception of
Jules who was Haitian born, but Sagesse could talk to them
fluently in their own language. He could talk four languages,
French, Spanish, English, and Portuguese; he had
picked the three foreign languages up as a means to trade,
and it was to his mastery of them, as much as his own
astuteness, that he owed his success in life.</p>

<p>One night, sultry and cloudless with the sea like frosted
silver under the starlight and the warm breathing of
the wind, Gaspard, going into the deck-house found Sagesse
seated at the table before a chart.</p>

<p>“If this wind holds,” said Sagesse, “we should sight
Martinique at dawn.” He spoke with his eyes upon the
chart, then, looking up: “What do you propose to do when
you get there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, as for me I don’t know,” said Gaspard taking a
seat opposite the other. “Report myself to the <i>Compagnie
Transatlantique</i>—draw what pay is owing to me, and try
and get recompense for my kit.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sagesse, “if I were in your place, I would
let all that slip.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ma foi</i>, how?—say nothing, or as little as you can,
report yourself, but do not trouble about compensation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
“And why?”</p>

<p>Sagesse laughed, “Because my friend, it is not well to
stir muddy water; you get before one of these infernal
clerks with a pen in his hand, and he takes notes of what
you say, you ask for compensation and he says, ‘Yes, yes,
that is just, compensation, certainly, but first my friend,
prove yourself to be whom you say you are, and give us
your story in detail.’ Then with the point of his pen he
turns you inside out and,” said Sagesse tapping on the
table with his thumb, “it is not well to be turned inside out
if one has anything to conceal.”</p>

<p>“To conceal?”</p>

<p>“For instance,” went on Sagesse, “the official of the <i>Compagnie
Transatlantique</i> might say, ‘Who was your engineer-in-chief,
who was your second engineer, had you a
chum, what was his name?’”. Sagesse watching Gaspard
narrowly saw the sweat start on his forehead, laughed, and
finished, “and you would not say, ‘His name is Yves, he
escaped with me, we landed on an island, he had a belt
about his waist and a pouch containing a number of valuable
gold coins which he had stolen, and I killed him and
took the money.’ You would not say that, perhaps, with
your tongue, but your face might give a hint, or your manner,
and a hint might lead to a suspicion, and a suspicion
to a search—<em>you should have burned that body</em>.”</p>

<p>Gaspard, staring at the man before him, felt as though
an ice-cold blade had been driven through his heart, his
flesh crawled. He had told all, then, to this man, and
more than all. He felt nothing of what the criminal feels
whose crime has been discovered, for he felt himself innocent
of crime or criminal intent. It was the horror of the
fact that he had given himself away, and under the influence
of drink had described the affair in such a manner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
that Sagesse believed him a murderer—this it was that
paralysed him for the moment.</p>

<p>For a moment only, then, thrusting his hands out as
though he were putting something away from him, he burst
out, “I did not kill him for money—it’s a lie. If I said
so I lied—it was an accident. True, we quarrelled about
the money, but I did not kill him for it. The knife only
scratched him and he dropped. I had saved his life; does
a man murder another whose life he has saved? When I
spoke, I was mad with your cursed drink. If I had murdered
him would I have told of it? I did not kill him for
money—do you believe me?”</p>

<p>“My friend,” replied Sagesse quite unmoved, “I believe
you. But you yourself admit the fact that you killed him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, by accident.”</p>

<p>“And took his money?”</p>

<p>“It did not belong to him. He had only just found it
amidst the bushes, the belt and the pouch. Why do you
shake your head, do you not believe me?”</p>

<p>“Whether I believe you or not, does it matter—? This
man had found money, you killed him—by accident, with
a knife, and took his money. Does your reason not tell
you that such a tale is enough to hang the Archbishop of
Paris—but it is all your affair, and as I said just now, my
advice is to let the thing lie. Do not disturb dead bones.
Let us forget it, and be practical. If I chose, I could
hand you over to the authorities at Martinique to-morrow.
I have marked on the chart the position where you boarded
me, and the position of that island, which is the only one in
that vicinity. But it would not be of the least profit to me
to get you into trouble. Not in the least. I would much
sooner help you. Well, to business. That money will be
your worst friend, instead of your best if you try to use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
it ashore as it is, you must change it for good American
dollars. Put it on the table and I will change it for you.”</p>

<p>“Before God,” burst out Gaspard, “I will do nothing
unless you believe me when I say that I came by it rightly,
that there is no stain of blood on it, that what happened
there on the island was an accident, and that I am no
murderer!”</p>

<p>Sagesse, who knew man thoroughly, and who ever since
the first morning of their acquaintance had been studying
him minutely, rose to his feet and slapped his right hand
down on the table palm uppermost.</p>

<p>“I believe you, there, the words are said and let us say
no more on the matter—how far others would believe you,
it is not for me to say, but there, let the matter end and
come to business.”</p>

<p>He sat down again, and Gaspard opening the pouch at
his waist put the coins on the table in a heap.</p>

<p>Sagesse counted them. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Dieu</i>,” said he, holding one in
his hand and examining it. “Fancy trying to change this
lot at a banker’s or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bureau de change</i>, they would be enough
to raise a blister on the reputation of a saint. I can get
rid of them, though; with difficulty it is true, but still I can
get rid of them. But I don’t take risks without a chance
of good profits. I will give you forty dollars for the lot.”</p>

<p>“Less than two dollars apiece?”</p>

<p>“Slightly.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mordieu</i>,” said Gaspard. “I would as soon throw them
overboard.”</p>

<p>Sagesse put both his elbows on the table and laughed.
Then the haggling began. Gaspard, the son of a tradesman,
had something of the business man in his nature.
It was a strange picture, and not without its romantic
side. The two southerners seated opposite to each other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
at the table of the dingy deck-house, the swinging lamp
overhead casting its light on the chart, the pieces of gold,
and the strenuous faces of the barterers.</p>

<p>One might imagine that Sagesse, having the game, seemingly,
in his hands, would have forced his terms on the
other; but that would be without counting on the character
of the Captain and the laws which governed his life.
“Never appeal to social laws unless in the last extremity.
Never use force against a man stronger than yourself.
Take the pyx, but leave the priest the chalice (in other
words—do not strip a man so bare that he will turn
upon you in desperation)”—these were three of the laws
governing this wise man’s actions. He was an artist in
scoundrelism, for he knew the value of restraint.</p>

<p>“Sixty dollars, then,” said Sagesse, after they had been
haggling for half an hour or more. “You agree, good, of
course I will make my profit on them, but what would you
have? I am a trader, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vé</i>—, and I will give you more than
sixty dollars; I will give you advice.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Don’t go back to the stokehold. With sixty dollars
in Martinique you may start a little business. Go shares
in a fishing boat, deal in fruit—you are young and active,
and in Martinique sixty dollars are equal to six hundred
at Havre or in Paris. I will shew you the ropes, as the
English say. Do you know, monsieur, that I, Pierre
Sagesse, have started by my advice and help a dozen people
in Martinique who are now prospering?”</p>

<p>He had risen, and all the time he was talking he was
searching in the locker where he kept his charts. At last
he drew forth a little chamois bag and, opening it, shot
out on the table the money it contained. The little bag
held exactly sixty dollars in gold coin and some silver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ma foi</i>, the exact sum; that is odd and ought to be
a sign of luck. There is your money, and I will not take
the belt and pouch; you can keep them.”</p>

<p>Gaspard pocketed the money. It was more than odd
that the little chamois leather bag held the exact sum in
question. He felt certain that Sagesse, days before, had
worked out the problem of what he should pay for the
coins, and had placed this sum in readiness.</p>

<p>The character of the man lay revealed in that act, as
also in the way he had kept dumb about Yves till the
moment of his purpose.</p>

<p>Gaspard felt certain that had it suited his interests
Sagesse would have betrayed him to the authorities. He
left the deck-house, and leaning against the starboard bulwarks,
looked over the starlit sea.</p>

<p>Though he had left the island blue leagues behind,
it still pursued him, and, in the form of Sagesse, still
had a hold upon him, the island and the deed committed
there.</p>

<p>He could see it still, just as he saw it when making
his escape. The sun-stricken palms, the white beach, the
white surf breaking on the beach, the white gulls—he
could hear their voices calling to him.</p>

<p>“Hi, Hi, Hi! You there in the boat! come back!
come back! Hi! think you to escape us? Ha! Ha! Hi!
Fishing, wheeling! calling! O the weariness, the blueness,
the waves, the wind, the sun. They are ours and
they are yours forever—forever—forever. Hi!”</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="subhead">THE MAGIC TOWN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>He was awakened next morning by the roar of the anchor-chain
through the hawse-pipe.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he was on deck.</p>

<p><i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>, steered by magic hands during
the night, had raised some magic horizon and passed it
to anchor in paradise. So it seemed to him as his eyes
travelled from the cloud turban of Mont Pelée coloured
by the dawn, and followed the tumbling woods, the cascades
of leaping foliage high, far off, dark in shadow,
falling to the hillside city; and the city breaking from the
woods, falling street by street to the harbour’s edge;
palm-tops peeping above the red-tiled roofs; houses,
shadows, palms; tracery of gardens, squares, step flights
from street to street; old moss-grown flights of steps, old
gardens and scraps of gardens giving shelter to the grenadilla
and the fleur d’amour; old houses, heavy-built and
lightly coloured, all stretching from the great high woods
to the very edge of the shadowy harbour in whose depths
the blue of night still lay.</p>

<p>The blue of night—though the sky above Pelée was
ablaze with the morning blue. Over on the east of the
island at Grande Anse the morning was already full and
splendid, but here the shadow of peak and morn held
everything in magical <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">chiara oscuro</i>. The city, seen as
though through a vague veil of gauze, seemed asleep, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
it was burning with early morning life, and Gaspard, as
he watched, could see the moving figures of people, forms
trickling down the steep flights of steps leading from street
to street, and swarming by the sea-steps and harbour side.</p>

<p>Held, just for a moment, in this curious twilight lingering
in the shadow of Pelée, whilst all the sea world beyond
flashed to the sun-blaze of the tropics, the old sea-city
of St. Pierre hanging, literally, between sky and sea,
between dawn and night, between the present and the
past, shewed to the mind those pictures of suggestion
which lie in tapestry and verse.</p>

<p>Gaspard had never seen anything at all like this. He
had seen many a tropic town where the galvanized tin
roof of the trader, or the rigid outlines of the Methodist
meeting house broke crudely through the beauty of palmiste
and orange. But St. Pierre lay before him beautiful,
absolutely beautiful, like a dream city set in Wonderland.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more wonderful than those torrential
woods far up above the houses, woods of balisier and palm,
tamarind, ceiba, and giant fern; lianas cable thick, air
shoots, all climbing in the twilight, and leading the eyes
to the slopes of Pelée and the peak, cloud-wreathed and
burning in the blue.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more strange or more poetical than
the city reaching from these woods to the shadowy sea.</p>

<p>Other vessels were anchored in the harbour, boats were
putting out from the shore; now, clear and sharp-cut,
through the vague noises of early morning came the note
of a bugle from the fort, and from a sailing-ship away to
starboard the clank of capstan pawls and the cry of sailors
hauling on the halyards.</p>

<p>With and through everything came the perfume of the
land, earth and tropic flowers, jasmine and vanilla scents,
mixed with the scent of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Gaspard turned from the city and looked westward.
Beyond the shadow of the island the sea lay in the bright
daylight, shewing beneath the emerald ring of the horizon
the virginal blue of early morning.</p>

<p>As he turned, Sagesse left the deck-house and stood for
a moment looking on the land before speaking to his
companion.</p>

<p>“Better than the stokehold,” said the Captain, who had
put on a clean suit of white drill, and a shore-going and
holiday manner; “better than the engine-room, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vé</i>! Look,
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canotiers</i> are putting off and the port officers will be
aboard us before we have finished breakfast.”</p>

<p>Jules appeared, as he spoke, from the caboose, bearing
a steaming coffee-pot; they went into the deck-house for
the meal, and before it was half through and, as if to
bear out the truth of Sagesse’s prediction, the port officers
arrived.</p>

<p>They came into the deck-house, where Sagesse served
them with vermouth and cigarettes; they seemed to know
Sagesse as a friend, and bill of lading or bill of health
seemed to trouble them very little as far as Gaspard could
judge, who, in the middle of the cigarette smoking and
exchange of news, left Sagesse to his friends and came on
deck.</p>

<p>He found a new St. Pierre. Colour had stolen over
the slopes of Pelée; light had stretched out her hand and
torn away the veil of twilight. A burst of blue struck
him in the face as he left the dingy deck-house. A sky of
blue, a sea of blue, triumphant, crystalline, dazzling, and
in the midst of this world of leaping lazulite, St. Pierre
standing like a dreamer awakened by the sea.</p>

<p>Awakened from where the high woods were rocking and
singing in the morning wind, to where the breeze-swept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
harbour was lipping ship side and quay with the flash
of sapphire satin.</p>

<p>One could see, so clear was the air, the tiles on the red-tiled
roofs and the palm fronds bursting above them; a
flag was flickering above some consulate, the palm-tops
were dancing to the breeze that bore on its hot breath the
scent of earth and trees and the sounds of the city that
seemed less a city than a daring aquarelle, blindingly
beautiful, triumphantly bright.</p>

<p>Round the <i>Belle Arlésienne</i> <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canotiers</i> were paddling;
banana-coloured children in little coffin-shaped canoes
made out of old packing-cases, canned meat cases, anything
in the form of a box that could be cut into the form
of a canoe. They were chattering to the black sailors,
and when they saw Gaspard they shouted to him to fling
them coins to dive for, but before he could put his hand in
his pocket Sagesse and the port officers left the deck-house.</p>

<p>The newcomers had offered to row Sagesse and Gaspard
ashore, and the captain had evidently told them of the fate
of the <i>Rhone</i>, for, as they crossed the harbour, Gaspard
found himself an object of interest and plied with a hundred
questions. At the sight of Sagesse the little <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canotiers</i>
had dispersed in every direction, and now, as they rowed,
Gaspard could hear the thin voices of the children chanting
a song; he caught the word “Sagesse” repeated over
and over again, but the lisping <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">patois</i> and the breeze
dimmed all else but the spirit of the ballad—Derision.
Sagesse was not, evidently, a favorite with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canotiers</i>
of St. Pierre, yet, to look at him seated by the port doctor,
a cigar in his mouth and his thumbs stuck in his waist-belt,
one might have fancied him a man to whom children
would run by instinct.</p>

<p>He was in grand good humour this morning; so was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Gaspard; so, too, seemed the port officers. The joyous
city seemed to radiate gaiety; the languor of midday had
not yet fallen upon it and it laughed like a child awakened
by a kiss on a bright morning.</p>

<p>The harbour-side was crowded; naked children, half-naked
men, black men, banana-coloured men, apricot-coloured
men, chattering in that French worn smooth which
is the language of the French West Indies, a language
in which <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Monsieur</i> becomes <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Missie</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Maman</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Manmam</i>, and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">France</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fouance</i>.</p>

<p>Amidst the ‘longshoremen, the idlers, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canotiers</i>, fishermen,
and boatmen, strayed the forms of a few women,
bright as tropic birds, graceful in striped foulards and
jupes of exquisite colours, their wasp-yellow turbans striking
the eye forcibly, the brightest points in a picture surcharged
with colour and blinding light.</p>

<p>Sinbad never landed at a stranger port than this, so
vividly real, so far removed from the commonplace, so
filled with the presence of the past.</p>

<p>Romance sat on the very sea-steps, and as Gaspard
landed he felt what every man who ever landed at St.
Pierre must have felt vividly or vaguely—her touch.</p>

<p>Sagesse, bidding good-day to the port officers, struck uptown
accompanied by Gaspard. Uptown, by flights of old
steps, worn, moss-grown, shadowed by the black shadows
of houses and roofed with a ribbon of blinding azure sky,
everywhere the sound of running water from the thousand
conduits and fountains, everywhere the sound of the sea
echoing as in the whorl of a great shell.</p>

<p>The stepways led to streets, lines of blazing light and
colour, verandahed, broken by black house shadows, filled
with coloured people of all shades, all hues, from the
muletresse to the chabine; all busy, moving, drifting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
chattering, buying or selling, finely formed, graceful as
the palmistes.</p>

<p>Then more steps haunted by fountain and sea sounds,
and they entered a river of light—the Rue Victor Hugo.</p>

<p>Gaspard, as he reached the street, looked back down
the steep and twilight vico they had ascended, and saw
the harbour, liquid shadow on which, seeming suspended
in air, floated <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>.</p>

<p>It was like a picture closing the first chapter of his life;
the sea, and the island, and the ever-crying gulls, dead
Yves, the stokehold, Marseilles, all lay there. Here was
a new land and the beginning of a new existence. The
sea, the island, the man he had slain—all beyond there.
It all seemed remote, done with forever; yet it was close
to him, potently alive in the form of Captain Sagesse,
and able to stretch out a hand and touch him on the
shoulder if so it chose.</p>

<span class="subhead">RUE VICTOR HUGO</span></h2>
</div>

<p>White umbrellas, striped verandahs, black shadows, laughter,
motion, colour, coloured people, coloured clothes,
lemon-tinted houses, flower-blue sky, a street of light beneath
a roof of azure, the Rue Victor Hugo lay before
Gaspard.</p>

<p>Looking straight before one, the scene recalled Naples,
Marseilles, Alexandria, with an extra touch as though a
gleam, a perfume, a voice, had stolen from some vanished
coloured city of the remote past; as though Pompeii had
sent an idler, Carthage a trader, Tunis a coloured child,
to lose themselves in the crowd and lend it, scarcely seen,
a heart-catching subtlety.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There is no sound of feet; everyone is shoeless; they
walk in a whisper under the wonderful blue light of the
sky, these people, these men and women of all shades of
yellow, graceful, dignified, gracious, who might seem the
inhabitants of a dream city but for the sounds of everyday
life, cries of cigar vendors, and pastry vendors, and fruit
sellers, children’s voices, laughter; now comes from far
away the music of a mirliton; it is playing in a street
below—Pouf! up a steep side street comes the sound,
louder, and carried on a breath of hot sea wind, and there
below the blue face of the harbour laughs up at you so
high above it. You pass on; the shops surround you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
again, and the crowd and the voices; you reach a little
square, a cube of colour; in its centre like a diamond
flower forever in motion, the jet of a fountain plays in
the sun, plays and sings to itself like the spirit of a
happy child; and here where human voices are less loud
you hear the sound of other fountains, the sound of rivulets,
runnels racing by the side walks, pipes that empty
into moss-grown channels all drawing their water from
Mont Pelée, fatherly, and seated far above the great torrential
woods, sky-throned, and turbaned with cloud.</p>

<p>You go on; the endless street bends and dips and rises
again, never quite level; houses and blue bursts of sea
alternating on the right, on the left, high above you, houses
that break with their sun-stricken yellow the green foliage
of the high woods. The torrent of yellow houses up above
seems tumbling to the sea, or, if you like it better, the
houses seem climbing to attack the woods. You can hear
from up there wood sounds, the piping of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">siffleur de
montagne</i>, the wash of moving foliage, just as you can
hear from below the sounds of the sea, the songs of the
fishermen, and the wash of the water on the beach.</p>

<p>As a curious and beautiful poem leads you to read on,
so the coloured and sunlit street leads you to follow it;
it brings you by a bridge across the Rivière Roxelane,
where the washerwomen work from dawn till dark, and the
boulders are snowed with linen, and so to the market-place,
where the strangest things from sea and land are
sold.</p>

<p>Beyond lie the mornes, green to the water’s edge; the
sea, the sky; great blue wastes of sun and silence.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>From a flower-seller as they entered the Rue Victor
Hugo, Sagesse had bought a gaudy blossom which he put
in his coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
He was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en fête</i> and his good humour was infectious;
linking his arm in that of Gaspard, he had led him into a
café, a cool, spacious shop set out with marble-topped
tables. On every table there was a little bowl filled with
bright-coloured blossoms; men were seated about, men in
cool white clothes and broad panama hats. As Gaspard
followed his companion between the tables he noticed
that all these men gave Sagesse good-day as though he
were an old acquaintance, but without enthusiasm, and
with a certain constraint.</p>

<p>Then, choosing a table in a corner, they sat down, and
Sagesse beckoned to the bartender. He came running.</p>

<p>He had been piling some glasses on a tray and had not
caught sight of the newcomers until just before Sagesse
beckoned to him; instantly, and almost upsetting the tray
in his haste, he came, and now he stood, a middle-aged
quadroon, mild-eyed, subdued-looking, standing before
Sagesse as a slave might stand before his master.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bonjour</i>, Jules.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bonjour</i>, missie.”</p>

<p>“How has trade been since I left?”</p>

<p>“Good, missie—Jules has been busy, very busy, for most
a month—before that not so good.” He spoke in the
Creole <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">patois</i>, soft, fluent, a language that seems made for
the lips of children.</p>

<p>Sagesse ordered drinks. When they were on the table
he lit a cigar, handed Gaspard another, and then, crossing
his legs and suddenly changing his manner:</p>

<p>“Let us talk business,” said he.</p>

<p>“Business?”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ma foi</i>, yes; that’s what they call it—business. See
here. I want the true story of the gold in that belt. I
want to know more about that island, and I want to know
something about that treasure-ship.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
When you encounter a tropical centipede the thing that
astonishes you most is the way in which it changes form,
now effacing itself altogether in some coign of shadow,
now drawn out, swollen, vicious, and ready to attack you,
now shrunken, drawn together, a mere nothing that, next
moment to a touch becomes distended and viciously alive.</p>

<p>The mind of Captain Sagesse seemed to possess this
centipede attribute.</p>

<p>Gaspard had imagined the affair of the island done
with; he had imagined that with the conclusion of the bargain
over the gold pieces Sagesse had passed the matter
behind him. He had said nothing about a treasure-ship.
The ship of coral in the lagoon had been always present
in his mind as a ship that might contain treasure, but he
had said nothing about it. How, then, had Sagesse read
his thoughts, and why had he not spoken of it before?</p>

<p>He stared at the Captain for a moment without speaking.
“But that’s all done with,” said he at last. “I’ve
told you my story; you’ve had your share in the stuff—Don’t
you believe me? And see here, what do you mean
about a treasure ship? I never said a word about such a
thing.”</p>

<p>“My friend,” said Sagesse, “between the captain and
the mate’s cabin on my vessel there is only a plank, and
when the man sleeping in the mate’s cabin shouts out in
his sleep ‘Hullo there, Yves, look, I can see through
her hatch; she’s full of gold; we’ll fetch it out—share
and share alike,’ the captain sets himself to think. He
says to himself, ‘this man talks of a ship full of gold in his
sleep; he came on board my ship from an island over there;
he had in his possession a number of old coins, old Spanish
pieces; he confesses in drink that he has killed Monsieur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Yves, the gentleman to whom in his dreams he talks of
a ship full of treasure; well, don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The conclusion—come, confess, you have a secret; give
me the full story of that affair, or by my soul and on my
honour I will call the authorities right in here and tell
them a lot of things I know.”</p>

<p>Sagesse, as he said the last words, changed completely,
and in a moment, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon bourgeois</i> vanished, his upper
lip raised slightly, disclosing the teeth. Just in that moment
he shewed himself what he was, not a villain of
romance, but that much more terrible individual, the petty
trader, heartless, careful, calculating. The squid of society
that, living on crabs and shell-fish, will, when opportunity
offers, seize and devour a man.</p>

<p>What numbed the mind of Gaspard was not fear of
the authorities, but fear of Sagesse and astonishment at
his methods.</p>

<p>He felt as though in the grip of some gelatinous thing,
this dusky mind had gripped him on board the <i>Belle
Arlésienne</i> and had seemed to let him go; its tentacles
had fallen from his arms, and now they were around his
feet. It was useless to fight with Sagesse; he was at
the man’s mercy; betrayed by drink, he had put himself
in the grasp of the cuttlefish.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said he at last, “before I tell you anything,
tell me this: Why did you not spring this on me
before? Why did you trade with me for those coins?
Why did you pretend to be my friend?”</p>

<p>“Why did I trade with you, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ma foi</i>? I traded with
you because I wanted those coins at a fair price; I
brought you here because I wanted to trade with you for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
your secret at a fair price with the law at my elbow. I
did not wish to conclude the bargain on board my own
ship; it gives a ship a bad name when men are brought
off her in chains by the police. I wanted no police on
board <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>. And as to pretending to be
your friend, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ma foi</i>, I am your friend, and you shall have
your share of the profits of your secret. But the truth
I must have, come—”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Dieu!</i>” cried Gaspard with a burst of irritation. “I
was hiding nothing from you. There <em>was</em> a wreck on the
island; I <em>did</em> think there was treasure on her, but I had
put it from my mind. I talked of it in my sleep, did I?
Well, it must have been there in my mind. You shall
have the story.”</p>

<p>Then, with his elbows on the table, he told how Yves
had discovered the ship in the lagoon; he described her.
Sagesse, also with his elbows on the table, listening intently,
putting in a question now and then.</p>

<p>“That’s all,” finished Gaspard, “she may be up to
the hatches with gold for all I know—and for the matter
of that—for all I care.”</p>

<p>Sagesse sat, now that the tale was told, musing in his
chair, and pulling at his heavy moustache.</p>

<p>“And you were on that island,” said he at last, “you
saw that wreck, you found gold and the dead bones of a
man, you fancied there might be more stuff there, yet,
if I had not got the tale from you you would have said
nothing to anyone about it; you would have perhaps gone
back to the stokehold. Pah! I believe you, for that’s
the kind of thing that fills stokeholds with fools who
are good for nothing but stoking—well, you will be fortunate
despite yourself. I take the speculation up.”</p>

<p>“You intend—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
“I intend to dynamite her open and see what she contains.
When <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> has discharged her
cargo, I will put her in ballast, take some diving apparatus
and what else is needful, and return to that island; you
will go with me.”</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you; do you think I want the whole of St. Pierre
in the business? I will take only my coloured crew; several
of them are good divers, but I must have another
white man on a job like this. You will have your share
of the profits, fifteen per cent. That may be much, or it
may be nothing, but you will have to work for it, for it
will be horse work getting the stuff off her if she lies
as you tell me. I take it she has been lying in that
lagoon all of a hundred years; if she is a Spaniard there
may be a lot of stuff—” Then, after a moment’s pause,
“There is stuff on that island; I smell it.”</p>

<p>He fell into a moment’s reverie, then, as if talking to
himself, “the fellow those bones belonged to had something
to do with her; he was one of her crew, or he was
there hunting for treasure. He may have died of starvation
or accident, or he may have discovered the stuff and
been killed by his companions; if that was so they would
not have left that belt and money behind them.”</p>

<p>Gaspard sat watching Sagesse; the man’s mind seemed
ferreting about the business like a hound; he seemed actually
to smell money in the thing. Perhaps he did. There
are men who in some uncanny way have the power of
scenting fortune; their speculations rarely fail; they know
what will appreciate in value, whether in land or stocks,
and they will throw up the most likely venture just because
their genius has discovered in it some hidden and
fatal flaw unperceived by other men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
As Gaspard sat watching Sagesse a faint glow of enthusiasm
began to warm his breast. What man is there to
whom the thought of hidden treasure does not appeal?
The idea of returning to the island would have been
hateful to him half an hour a go, but already his heart was
stirring to the venture.</p>

<p>He would not be alone.</p>

<p>Already he had divined the main points of Sagesse’s
character—or fancied he had—. He felt him to be cold-blooded,
heartless, calculating, yet he fancied that if
Sagesse offered him fifteen francs out of every hundred
he made on the business he would keep his word.
With such a small percentage in view it would be easier
to keep his word than break it and make trouble. Sagesse
came out of his reverie.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, relighting his cigar, which had gone
out, “there’s an end of the matter. I take the thing up;
I put my money in it; I offer you your fifteen per cent.;
I put you in the way, perhaps, of a small fortune. I
make you, in fact, a small partner in what may be a
big concern. Half an hour ago you were a Moco, and
your end was the drinking bar and the stokehold; you had
stuff in your head that was valuable to me and I had to
blast it out of your skull by threats of the law, just as
I will blast the stuff out of that hooker with dynamite.
Well, what do you think of Pierre Sagesse? Is he a
man who knows his way about? Is he a man worth following?
I’m frank as day when I choose to be frank,
and I tell you now, you may take the offer or leave it;
come with me, well and good; refuse it, and I will get
another man. Only, remember this, if you refuse you
get nothing.”</p>

<p>“What you offer is perhaps fair enough,” said Gaspard,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
“but this I will say, straight out, you treated me as a
friend this morning; you took my arm, you brought me
in here, you stood for drinks, and then you threatened
me with that affair. I don’t like that, and be you who
you may, I say so.”</p>

<p>Sagesse took a puff at his cigar and then patiently, as
though explaining things to a child:</p>

<p>“You, this morning, were going about like a man with
a jewel in his empty skull; I operated like a surgeon, and
took it out; it was unpleasant, but there is the jewel, and
instead of charging you a fee I offer you a percentage
on the value. If I had not threatened, you would not have
told. Well? What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I don’t say I won’t come—on one condition—that you
never name that affair again or threaten me with it.”</p>

<p>Sagesse laughed. “Threaten you, why should I? I
have used the instrument, I fling it away. I have got all
I want out of you, and now it is your turn to profit a bit.
You will be very useful, and I don’t want a stranger in
the business.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Gaspard, true Provençal that he was,
“fifteen per cent.—make it twenty—”</p>

<p>“Not a cent more than fifteen, not a cent, not a centime.
I never go back on an offer of that sort.”</p>

<p>“When do you start?”</p>

<p>“It will take me a week to clear the cargo and get
ready; meanwhile you have your pocket full of dollars,
and you can amuse yourself.”</p>

<p>“I will come.”</p>

<p>“Your word on that.”</p>

<p>“I give you my word.”</p>

<p>You will perhaps have divined that in the character of
Gaspard, a character primitive enough, childlike in some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
ways, and swayed by elemental passions, there lay a streak
of straightness. To this man, who would not have known
the meaning of “ethics,” straight-dealing came as a natural
gift. Sagesse had divined this fact and valued it, for,
speaking generally, there is no man in the world who
values honour in another more than your rogue.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the Captain, rising from his seat. “I
have business to do, and so have you. The <i>Compagnie
Transatlantique</i> office is close here; go and report yourself;
the port authorities will have you up before them
too; you will most likely find their man at the shipping
office, for I said you would be there, and, see here, you
will want a suit or two of white drill; those clothes you
have are too heavy for Martinique. Then you’ll want a
room; there are sailors’ boarding-houses by the harbour,
steer clear of them.”</p>

<p>He took a little notebook from his pocket and wrote
a name and address on a sheet of paper, tore it out and
handed it to his companion.</p>

<p>“Go there. Manman Faly, Rue du Morne, No. 3.
She’ll put you up and find you a place. It’s off the Grande
Rue. You’ll easily find it; come.”</p>

<p>He turned to leave.</p>

<p>“We haven’t paid for the drinks,” said Gaspard, putting
his hand in his pocket.</p>

<p>Sagesse laughed. “I never pay here; the place is mine;
Jules there manages it for me; he’s one of my people.”</p>

<p>Gaspard was soon to learn how many unfortunates
in St. Pierre came under that designation, “One of my
people.”</p>

<p>They passed out into the blinding street, under the
flower-blue sky. Only twenty yards or so down lay the
shop where clothes could be bought. Here Gaspard for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
twenty-two francs bought two suits of white drill, a pair
of white canvas shoes, and an imitation panama. He put
on one of the suits, and ordering the other to be sent to
the address in the Rue du Morne, walked out again feeling
a new man.</p>

<p>In all his past, a shore landing had meant a landing
in grimy clothes, smoking and drinking in grimy bars,
the foetor of the dock-side. Never before had he found
himself walking in a clean, bright city, in clean, new
clothes. It was delightful, new, absolutely new, and
filled with the freshness of surprise.</p>

<p>A pretty capresse girl glanced at him, and that was the
last touch to his vanity; he entered the office of the <i>Compagnie
Transatlantique</i>, where Sagesse left him, walking
with an assured step, made his deposition before the manager
and one of the port authorities who was present,
signed it, and then, quite sure of himself and disregarding
Sagesse’s advice, demanded an indemnity for his lost kit
and his wages up to date.</p>

<p>For once the wise Sagesse had given the wrong advice,
for the manager, on his own responsibility, and partly,
perhaps, as a tribute to the cleanest and most self-respecting
stoker he had ever fallen in with, made out an order
for the money demanded, cashed it, and Gaspard left the
office richer by a hundred francs.</p>

<p>The tide of luck was in full flood that morning, and
he did nothing to spoil it; as he passed along with the
moving crowd, cafés called out to him to come in and celebrate
the occasion, but he passed them by; he had no need
of the help of alcohol; the bright light, the colours, the
movement around him, and the light-hearted, yet languorous
atmosphere of the gay city set all his southern nature
aglow; just as blue eyes are made bluer by blue attire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
so the opal of the south in his mind took brighter colours
from the bright colours around it.</p>

<p>The insect had found a leaf similar to the leaf on which
it was born.</p>

<p>Unconscious of the fact that he was marching straight
upon his fate, he passed along looking into the shops,
strange shops without glass fronts or names, black shadows
under arched doorways, shadows shewing merchandise
and coloured people, shadows casting perfumes of flowers
and fruit, garlic scents.</p>

<p>He was crossing the little square where the diamond
fountain jet was dancing and singing in the sun, when
he saw before him the figure of a girl. She was coming
along in the full blaze of light, a girl of scarcely sixteen,
tall, swift moving, and graceful as Atalanta, a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i>, bearing on her head a tray of some merchandise
covered over with a wasp-coloured scarf.</p>

<p>The load would have taxed a man, yet she bore it as
easily as a feather; she wore no shoes, and her striped
robe was caught up at the waist to give her limbs free
play, shewing her leg almost to the knee.</p>

<p>She was of that strange race, whose blood has been
mixed with the blood of the Caribs, coloured like that Grecian
statuary to which during a thousand years the sun has
lent some trace of his gold, till one can imagine the sunlight
lingering in the honey tints of the marble.</p>

<p>The blue black of her hair just shewed, covered with
the turban of striped material on which rested the tray.</p>

<p>As she came, walking erect and without a motion of
the head, her dark eyes glanced from side to side, and
as she reached Gaspard her eyes met his full, nor did
they lower nor turn away till she had passed him.</p>

<p>He felt blinded as if by a flame. He turned. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
was vanishing amidst the crowd in the Rue Victor Hugo.
He made a step as if to follow her, then he stopped dead
as though before a barrier.</p>

<p>The glance had only lasted a moment, yet in that
moment, in a flash, they had spoken one to the other. It
was as though they had recognized one another.</p>

<p>He could read a mysterious something in her glance,
and it was as though she had said, “Ah, there you are,
from away beyond the beginning of time!”</p>

<p>The fountain was playing in the sun and a hundred
men and women were meeting and passing each other in
the little Place, but it was the meeting and passing of
coloured phantoms.</p>

<p>A man and a woman had just met and passed one
another.</p>

<p>A miracle of life had taken place, the old, strange miracle
forever fresh, forever new. Yet nothing told of it, till,
as he watched the moving crowd into which she had vanished,
suddenly, as if some belfry in the sky had swung
to life, came the clash and ripple of bells.</p>

<p>It was the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carillon</i> of the cathedral that rang thrice
daily. Golden, joyous, sonorous; tenor and alto; beating
the echoes to silver, waking ghostly voices in the mornes
and high woods, floating out over the blue sea.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BELLS AND THE RAIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It rains very often on the west of Martinique. The day
is joyous, brilliant, gaudy with the yellow of the city and
the blue of sky and sea. Pelée, with his turban of cloud,
sits tranquilly in eternal summer, then, as though at the
pointing of some wizard’s wand, it rains. Clouds overcast
the blue, the thunder of the rain on roof and verandah
mixes with the rush of rivulet and runnel.</p>

<p>It was as though the bells had called the clouds. Suddenly
the people were scampering, the rain was lashing.
Gaspard, who had sought the shelter of a doorway, could
hear the thunder of the verandahs all along the Rue Victor
Hugo, an arpeggio played by the fingers of the rain.
Wind had risen, and from above came the voice of the great
trees beating their wet green bands together, the sigh
of the palmiste bending to the wind, the whisper of tree ferns;
from the street below the Rue Victor Hugo came
the fainter tune of rain-stricken verandah and flowing
runnel, laughter, voices calling one to another across the
dividing rain, the voices of children and, still, through it
all, the bells.</p>

<p>Rain, wind, tree sounds, perfumes of new wet foliage and
earth, spouting of the gouyave water, children’s voices, and
through it all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carillon</i> of the bells, sweet, joyous vibrant,
like the voice of the love that lives through darkness
as through sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
And now, look! A burst of blue above; the bells have
broken a way to heaven, a last thunder from the verandahs,
like a parting salvo, and the squall is making a rainbow
over the blue sea.</p>

<p>It is over. The verandahs and shop doors are emptying,
pretty faces are turned up to the sky as if to test the truth
of its blueness, and white umbrellas are opening against
the sun.</p>

<p>Gaspard leaving shelter set out to find the Rue du Morne.</p>

<p>His mind was still filled with the image of the girl, the
girl with the face of a beautiful child and the eyes of a
woman, but the business he was on soon drove her picture
from his mind.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, can you direct me to the Rue du Morne?”</p>

<p>Monsieur, an old Creole gentleman under a white umbrella,
can and does, but his directions are given in the
Creole <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">patois</i>, and so rapidly that what he says seems one
word. Gaspard making out that the Rue du Morne lies
somewhere below finds a side street leading downward to
the blue dream of the harbour.</p>

<p>One could almost tumble into the harbour from here,
at least in imagination. Never was there so steep a street,
it is mostly steps, foot-worn, moss-grown, murmurous with
water, for the side runnels are in spate after the rain.</p>

<p>“Madame, can you direct me to the Rue du Morne?”</p>

<p>In the street below an old Creole lady under a white
umbrella, the female replica of the old gentleman in the
street above, replies to the question volubly, and also seemingly
in one word.</p>

<p>He gathers that it lies somewhere up above, but too
lazy to climb he pursues his way along the street which is
a replica of the Rue Victor Hugo. It is now getting towards
the drowsy time of day. The streets are emptying.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
He enquires his way as he goes and everyone is delighted
to direct him. Sometimes it seems the Rue du Morne lies
above, sometimes below; he comes to the conclusion that
all these delightful people do not know in the least what
they are talking about. In another city he would now be
irritable, in St. Pierre he is only drowsy, mesmerised by
the hopeless search; it does not seem to matter a bit, he
would just as soon sleep under that coloured sky when it
is filled with stars, as in a room in the Rue du Morne, No. 3.</p>

<p>A banana-coloured baby eating a banana at a doorway
draws his attention, he is fond of children, and this thing,
stark naked like a honey-coloured cupid, attracts him.</p>

<p>He takes his hat off to it derisively.</p>

<p>“Monsieur, can you direct me to the Rue du Morne?”</p>

<p>It can, apparently, in a voice hoarse as a crow’s and
with a thumb pointed to the sky, then it vanishes into the
house suspicious, maybe, that it has been trapped into
talking to a <em>Zombi</em>.</p>

<p><em>Zombis</em> are evil spirits, shapes, wizards. Now, in a little
street, steep as a stairway, dusky with house shadows,
framing a glimpse of blue sea, he asks the question for the
last time of an old woman with a patient, kindly face, who
has come to her doorway for a breath of air.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is the Rue du Morne, and No. 3, this is it.”</p>

<p>She is Manman Faly.</p>

<p>They like each other at sight, and he explains what he
wants, shews her a handful of money, and follows her into
the house.</p>

<p>She shews him into a room clean, but almost destitute
of furniture.</p>

<p>In one corner is an “elephant,” not an animal, but a mattress
two feet thick.</p>

<p>It is the thing he has been yearning for. St. Pierre has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
seized him at last, the drowsy languorous spirit has been
leading him by the arm for the last half hour, it leads him
now to the mattress and tells him to lie down. He does,
and almost immediately falls asleep, whilst Man’m Faly
closes the door and leaves him to take her own siesta.</p>

<p>Towards the evening he wakes up, has some food, a
drink at the bars by the star-flashing harbour, returning
sober and early to his room.</p>

<p>There is no glass to the window of his room—not a pane
of glass in the whole city, except maybe the coloured panes
of the cathedral—and as he lies fully awake before sleeping,
he can hear through the slats of the shutters, the voice
of St. Pierre by night; the tune of a thousand rivulets,
fountains, water-pipes.</p>

<p>The whole city is held by sleep, yet it sings the whole
night long, answering the sea below, and the woods above.</p>

<span class="subhead">LOVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the south, at night, the trees are full of voices. Dare
you sit in the woods of Martinique at night you would hear
in the green twilight that the moon makes through the
leaves, an orchestra louder and more fantastic than ever
filled a midsummer’s night’s dream.</p>

<p>Here in the daytime there is silence. One can hear the
waterfall, the distant river, the wind in the trees above,
sounds that only serve to make the background of silence
more apparent.</p>

<p>At high noon, when the light is fullest, when the heat
is greatest, and the wind above stricken dead, the silence
of the woods is terrific.</p>

<p>There is no silence in the whole world like to this, unless
it be the dumbness of a great multitude.</p>

<p>Around you on all sides life is rocketing and blazing;
orchids, hibiscus, bursts of bloom, ceibas, sand-box trees,
air shoots of the wild pine blossom and riot, uncanny because
of their demonstrative life in this silence.</p>

<p>But at dark all changes. Night rushes into the high
woods like some mad musician, conductor of an orchestra
crazy as himself.</p>

<p>The blue day outside closes up swiftly like a great painted
fan, just like the pictures on a fan rapidly closed, St.
Pierre tucks itself into a pocket of shadow, the mornes and
mountains are shrivelled up, Pelée alone remains sun-stricken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
still, then he, too, vanishes in a crease and as suddenly
reappears; for the fan, flirted open again to its full extent,
shews the same picture, only this time it is lit by starlight
or the light of the moon.</p>

<p>It is with the first closing out of the light that the
orchestra of the woods begins; shrill, tremulous, like the
bleating of a flock of lilliputian goats, the voices of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cabritt-bois</i> and his mates fill the shadows, then the moon
strikes the green heart of the forest and it springs alive
like a rattle. A million fantastic things give tongue. One
might fancy forms to fit the insect noises of the northern
woods, but the wildest imagination pauses before the possibilities
of this tropical band, these drummers and harpers
whose burr and rattle sways and surges beneath the farandole
of the fireflies.</p>

<p>At four o’clock, just as Pelée sights the coming sun, and
the dawn is coming over the sea like a lilac-coloured
breeze, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cabritt-bois</i> ceases his bleating and Plong! the
last harper plucks the final note from his harp-string. The
drummers put up their drums, the oboe, and piccolo, the
microscopic sax-horn player, the bones, and flute, pocket
or shoulders their instruments and depart—for dreamland
maybe.</p>

<p>They have made music all night, music that has reached
even the dreamers of St. Pierre. The people asleep in the
city become aware in their sleep that something has ceased,
the faint haze of sound from the great wood above surrounds
them no longer and they wake.</p>

<p>Gaspard awoke just as the wood music ceased. On the
black floor of the room the dawn through the slats of the
shutter was laying seven blue-grey bars upon the floor.</p>

<p>He had been dreaming of the island and of Sagesse.
They had burst into the treasure ship and the strand was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
strewn with bars of gold. Then he lost Sagesse and was
hunting for him and for Yves. It was full day, and the
island lay sweltering under the sun. He could see nothing
of the man he was in search of; then, far away at the end
of the little coral pier he saw a form that made him forget
both Yves and Sagesse, the form of a girl.</p>

<p>As he drew closer, he saw that it was the girl. The
girl of the little Place where the fountain played. The
Place de la Fontaine as he called it in his own mind, not
knowing its real name.</p>

<p>She was standing with her tray balanced on her head as
though she had just landed, now she was laughing as she
saw him coming towards her, laughing as only the girls of
Montpellier or Avignon can laugh and, as he came along the
ridge of coral he was laughing too, as he balanced himself,
fearful of falling. Then the ridge of coral became the
yard of a ship, the blue water below became distant, and
the dream broke up.</p>

<p>Happy dream. He had almost forgotten her last night,
chatting and smoking with foreign sailors at the bar of a
tavern. She must have struck him hard to make him dream
about her like that, for in the dream it seemed to him he
had known her a long time, that he was her declared lover;
this girl whom he had never seen before and whom he
might never meet again.</p>

<p>Now, a tap came to the door, and his landlady’s voice
offered him coffee or syrup. She brought the coffee in,
and placed it on the floor beside him and put the shutters
aside, so that the window space became a square dim disc
of light, through which, with a breathing of wind, came a
tang from the sea below and a breath from the woods above.</p>

<p>St. Pierre was already astir; he could hear women’s
voices and the prattle of children, Creole street cries; unfamiliar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
voices, scents, and sounds came through the open
window space, awakening him thoroughly, and awakening
in him a keen sense of curiosity such as he had never experienced
in any other port.</p>

<p>The people here seemed different from the people anywhere
else. Like a child who, turning over the leaves of
a dull book, comes upon a surprising and joyously-coloured
picture, he felt a pleasure he could neither analyse nor understand.
An educated man would have felt as he felt,
but cursed by convention and knowledge, and the catch
words of language, he would not have felt it so freshly as
this child of the south, who, like all the children of the south
had some inborn love for all that the true poets sing about
and true artists paint.</p>

<p>Having dressed himself he left the house. Man’m Faly
was nowhere to be seen, and the Rue du Morne was steeped
in curious twilight shewing at its end an extraordinary
vision of twilit sea, spreading out to ghost-blue sea and
out, away, and beyond the great mountain shadows, to a
sea of stainless azure.</p>

<p>He struck upwards to the street above, and then by a
flight of steps to the Rue Victor Hugo. The street was
astir. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Blanchisseuses</i> with bundles making their way to
the Rivière Roxelane, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">calendeuses</i> on their way to their
employment, shopkeepers, children, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuses</i> balancing
their loads upon their heads, starting on the long journeys
these women make daily over the island, all moving in the
twilight of very early dawn with, overhead, the hyacinth-blue
sky of morning.</p>

<p>The great fan picture of starlit city, sea, and wood, had
been snapped to, and now the magic fan was slowly reopening
to shew the same picture sunlit. Pelée and the
sea were already in view, and as Gaspard made his way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
along the Rue Victor Hugo, the day bloomed brighter overhead,
dimness of hyacinths turning to the flashing of
sapphires. The air, though still surcharged with shadow,
had in it now an obscure brightness, a negative light that
became positive where any bright surface shewed, shadows
were beginning to form, and the little fountain in the Place
de la Fontaine was returning from a dancing and whispering
ghost to the form of a dancing diamond flower.</p>

<p>He followed the street as it dipped and rose and dipped
again to the Rivière Roxelane. He was wondering in what
house of all this strange city, what street, was hidden the
girl of yesterday.</p>

<p>He had taken his way along the Rue Victor Hugo and
through the little Place, perhaps because it was there he
had met her; who knows; he was quite unconscious of the
manner in which she had taken hold upon him, and, infecting
him with that dark glance, had caused something to stir
and live in his blood; unconscious as the man who was
yesterday infected by malaria and to whom the first faint
chill tells nothing of the burning fever to follow.</p>

<p>He paused for a moment on the bridge and looked down
at the ghost-dim river raving along to the sea; the banks
seemed strewn with snow, it was the linen of the washerwomen,
he could hear their voices above the rushing of the
river, and the sound they made beating the clothes against
the boulders.</p>

<p>Then he passed on and found himself in the market-place
on the Place du Fort.</p>

<p>Long before light, under the stars, boats from the fishing
grounds had been making for St. Pierre, laden with the
catch of the night. From Calebasse, Morne Rouge, Marigot,
Vauclin, men and animals laden with country produce
had come into the city before dusk on the previous evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Light was now striking through the trees of the market-place,
the stalls were set out and laden, boats had been
dragged right up from the shore on rollers, and their
flashing cargoes were being unladen right at the stalls,
great fish still quivering and jumping with life, an albicore,
big almost as a shark, that took three men to lift, blue fish,
black fish, silver fish, fish that looked as though carefully
painted by hand, fish of all the forms that fish can possibly
take, lay exposed on the stalls or were being unladen from
the boats.</p>

<p>When Gaspard entered the market the place was in
shadow; flowers, fish, fruit were there, merchants to sell
them, and people to buy them, but it was like a market-place
in dreamland—a shadowy, yet living and moving
picture, almost voiceless—. Pelée is holding everything in
his mesmeric gloom.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It is morning, yet it is not. Then, almost in a moment
everything changes, golden sunbeams stray through the
leaves of the trees, the Place du Fort becomes beautiful
with bright light and liquid shadow, an unutterably blue
sea is born suddenly, and as if by enchantment beneath a
sky of unutterable blue. The market-place thrills, fills
with voices, it is like a great cage of birds that break into
chatter and song at the first touch of sunlight; you can hear
the songs of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canotiers</i> from the sea, songs of the fishermen
as they haul the last boatful of fish—hale it right
through the market, laughing as they sing and followed by
naked laughing children; girls’ voices, men’s voices, buyers,
sellers, idlers all mix and blend with the fresh voice of the
sea. It has a touch of the morning of the world before the
smoke of the first cities dimmed the beauty of the dawn,
before man had learned to weep and think. Here amidst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the tamarinds and the early sunlight of the Place du Fort,
for a moment you can catch the blue robe of the past, for a
moment you can stand in the market-place of early Alexandria,
for a moment you can glimpse the Agora of Athens
in her early youth, touch the summer that vanished before
Rome flung out her bastions and those legions whose spears
reflected the last gleams of the Golden Age.</p>

<p>For a moment—then Finotte flutters before you in her
wasp-coloured turban, basket in hand, and beautiful as a
butterfly in her striped foulard, and you are back again in
St. Pierre.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>With these people a man of Gaspard’s class could fraternize
and find friends at sight. Touched with the spirit of
the place, he laid hold of the gunwale of the last boat and
helped to haul her along, the Creole boatman laughing and
chattering with him in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">patois</i> which he only half understood.
He was French and a man from the big ships,
evidently out for a spree, that was enough for them. When
they had got the boat in position at a corner of the fish
market, for the place was divided, the fish and meat being
sold at one side, fruit, vegetables, and flowers at the other,
they began to sell their fish right from the boat without
troubling to put it on a stall.</p>

<p>Heavens! what fish were in that boat, and what a picture
they made fresh from the sea and still quivering; frilled,
horned, spined, fantastically coloured. Black and red
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perroquets</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">souris</i> pink and orange, blue fish, yellow fish,
all glittering like jewels; gelatinous masses that came in
clinging to the nets, seaweeds. It was as though a great
hand had been dipped in the tropical sea bringing up everything
it could grasp. One looked for a mermaid—now the
boatmen hammering with sticks were calling out their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
wares, holding up their fish, joking with the crowd; Gaspard
joining in, his white teeth and dark eyes flashing, the
picture of one of those boatmen one sees on the sea-steps of
Naples, only better dressed. He had seized a huge eel
and was holding it up, in a moment it was gone, bought,
and Pierre-Alphonse—so he had dubbed the chief boatman—nicknaming
him with any name that came first into
his head, as these men do—was pocketing the coins.
Pierre-Alphonse had conducted the barter whilst Gaspard
had held the eel, a pretty girl had bought it and carried it
off in her basket, and now Pierre-Alphonse seizing a monster
shaped like a little barrel, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">barrique de vin</i>—thrust it
into the new salesman’s hands. “Sell him too, thou man
from the sea—Fish! fish! fish! who’ll buy?—all alive and
breathing, all fresh from the water, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tonne</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">volant</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">balaou</i>,
all leaping at thee. Hi Dodotte—Pauline, where are you
going with your baskets—fill them.” He seemed to know
everyone; the little children crowded round, he gave them
handfuls of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sádines</i>, little white fish, let them pick seaweed
out of the boat, patted them on the head, all with his left
hand, as it were, whilst with his right hand and the whole
energy of his mind and body he continued selling. He was
a big man, Pierre-Alphonse, with a big, dark, smiling face
good to look at altogether, and evidently a “character” of
the market, and a favourite.</p>

<p>Gaspard had sold the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">barrique de vin</i> to a syndicate of
two old women who had combined to buy it, and perhaps
peddle it round town with other produce, for they had with
them a small cane truck, when, turning to the boat to find
something else to sell, he saw in the midst of the surrounding
crowd the girl. She was without her tray, her little
shapely head was bound with a yellow and blue madras,
she had a basket in her hand, and she was coming to buy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
fish. Then she saw Gaspard. Their eyes met and she
instantly looked away.</p>

<p>Pierre-Alphonse saw her, too.</p>

<p>Not only had she looked away, she had turned away.</p>

<p>Pierre-Alphonse’s mouth flew open:</p>

<p>“Hi, Marie—Marie de Morne Rouge—ho, Marie, are
you deaf this morning? Here are the fish calling thee—she’s
gone—” Then to Gaspard, “Now what devil has got
into the girl—she often buys from me, she was coming,
and she is gone—no matter, here is another <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">barrique</i>—sell
him, O thou man from the sea—”</p>

<p>“Who is she?” asked Gaspard, taking the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">barrique</i>.</p>

<p>“Marie—whose father lives at Morne Rouge.”</p>

<p>“Where does she live?”</p>

<p>“With her aunt in the street of the Precipice. Ho, there,
Mayotte, here is a fish for thee pretty as thyself—take it
for nothing—next to nothing, two sous and it is thine, ’tis
as big as a baby—”</p>

<p>“What is she, this Marie?”</p>

<p>“A <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i>—there, ’tis thine—wait till I get the change,
and thy mother, how is she? All sweetly I hope—there,
take thy change, little one—” all in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">patois</i> that takes
the sharpness from words, makes new words of old, a
tropical growth of language, coloured, quaint, infantile.</p>

<p>Gaspard turned to Pierre-Alphonse. “Well, I must be
going, good luck—” He disengaged himself from a fishy
embrace and, followed by a shower of good wishes from
Pierre-Alphonse and his crew, mingled with the crowd.
The girl was nowhere to be seen, there were pretty girls
everywhere, but he had no eyes for them.</p>

<p>Was she angry with him? Why had she turned away?
Five minutes ago, as he stood there helping Pierre-Alphonse
to sell his fish, he had forgotten her; if he had never seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
her again he would not have troubled very much; but, now,
something inexplicable had happened, the world had altered
in a flash, it was as though to a man going blindly along
a misty road the vision of a beautiful and unattainable
country had suddenly appeared through a rent in the mist
which closed again destroying the vision, but leaving the
dream. He was in love.</p>

<p>He crossed the Place, and wandered amongst the stalls
where fruit, vegetables, and flowers were sold. Here the
air had a heady and intoxicating perfume, the place was
glorious with colour, piles, and mounds of colour, such
fruit! such vegetables! such flowers! Egg plants, pommes
d’Haiti, oranges—green oranges, tiny monkey oranges,
giant oranges—giant apricots each the size of a turnip,
osier baskets filled with green nutmegs, custard apples,
guavas, white and green christophines, prickly pears—then
the vegetables, palm tops, and sweet potatoes, bread fruit—choux.
And the flowers, grenadilla blossoms and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleurs
d’amour</i>, flowers of the Loseille Bois, delicate butterfly
blossoms, poised as if forever in the act of taking flight.
Gaspard had ceased looking for the girl in the kaleidoscopic
throng around him, he was standing at a stall half of which
was laden with fruit of every colour, the other half with
every coloured flowers when, turning, he found that she was
beside him.</p>

<p>She was quite unconscious of the fact. Wandering
amidst the crowd she had drifted against him, touched him
with her elbow without being aware of whom she was
touching until he turned and their eyes met for the third
time in their lives; then, all at once, and as though the
faint reflection of a rose had been cast upon her face and
neck, she blushed—it was less a blush than a deepening of
the southern dusk beneath her skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
It told him at once that she recognised him, not only
that; in some mysterious way it told him that she had been
thinking of him. It gave him courage.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bonjour</i>, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bonjou</i>, missie.”</p>

<p>It was the salutation that everyone gave to everyone
else in St. Pierre, strangers, friends, everyone. She was
passing on when, picking up a spray of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleur d’amour</i>
from the stall and flinging some coins on the board, he
handed the branch laden with delicate blossoms to her.
She took it, glanced at him with a half smile, then she
looked at the flowers as though she had never seen flowers
before, her lips were moving, she was murmuring something,
speaking to the flowers, to the branch, “Oh, thou art pretty—thou
art sweet.” Then she had passed away; with a
glance and a little bow to the giver of the flowers she had
dissolved before his sight in the coloured moving throng.</p>

<p>But her voice remained with him, the caressing words
she had spoken to the flowers in the infantile French of
the tropics.</p>

<p>“Oh, thou art pretty—thou art sweet—” She had spoken
to the flowers, but it seemed to Gaspard she had spoken
of herself. She had described herself unconsciously in a
sentence.</p>

<p>He passed on. He did not wish to find her again just
then. The vision held him satisfied for the moment. She
was not angry, more than that, she was not indifferent. To
this man, direct and fierce in love as in hate, this girl of
his own class was a revelation, she seemed less a woman
than a flower that had suddenly blossomed in his path.</p>

<p>The elements of all the grandest poetry live in the commonest
man; deaf to the stuff of the drawing-room ballad
maker, blind to the embroideries of art, the eternal terrors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
and beauties of nature move him much or little as the case
may be, but they move him. The commonest man would
have felt something of the poetry, simple, and sweet, yet
exotic and beyond words fascinating, which this girl carried
with her—cast around her as the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleur d’amour</i> casts
its colour and perfume.</p>

<p>“O thou art pretty—thou art sweet—” He was turning
to leave the market-place when a scream from one of the
market women made him wheel round.</p>

<p>The stall just behind him had been upset, the crowd was
scattering in every direction.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fer de lance—fer de lance!</i>”</p>

<p>The cry echoed from one end of the Place to the other,
and Gaspard found himself standing alone, face to face
with an old gentleman dressed in white and holding a white
umbrella over his head.</p>

<p>The old man, though seemingly paralysed by terror, had
not dropped his umbrella. His eyes were fixed on the
ground where, writhing in the dust, a yellow snake was
raising its head to strike him.</p>

<p>It was a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i>, young, about three feet in length,
but terrible as Death himself. It had come to market hidden
in the great clusters of yellow bananas, frightened and
ferocious; hating the sunlight, it was preparing to strike
at the man before it, terror striking at terror.</p>

<p>The sight of the reptile left Gaspard quite unperturbed.
The smallest minority of the great human race are certainly
the people who have no dread of snakes. Gaspard
belonged to this few, a strange fact considering his imaginative
nature. It is true he knew nothing of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i>
and its terrors, but if he had, I doubt if he would have done
otherwise than he did.</p>

<p>The snake, obsessed by its objective, did not perceive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
the fearless enemy behind it; springing forward in a flash
Gaspard seized it naked-handed just below the horrible
triangular head; seizing it four inches lower down with his
left hand he almost twisted the head from the body, breaking
the spine at the neck. Then he flung the remains on
the ground and planted his heel on the head, crushing
bone and demon brain, and burning eyes into the dust.</p>

<p>The next moment it seemed to him that the world had
gone mad and was trying to smother him. The old man
he had saved was clinging to his neck, the whole market
was surging round him; men laughing, women weeping, and
crying out to the Virgin. One might have thought Gaspard
the bearer of the news of some national triumph, the
saviour of the island—that is to say, if one were not acquainted
with the Creole mind and its excitability. Then
a ring was formed and he found himself in the centre of
it, the old man—still with the umbrella over his head—holding
his hand, shaking it, and talking at the same time.</p>

<p>“I am Monsieur Seguin, any of these good people here
know me—” murmurs of assent from the crowd, “you have
saved my life at the risk of your own, I am your friend.
Ask what you will, I am not poor, my house is yours, and
all I possess. My life is yours, for have you not saved it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing,” cried Gaspard, “I have done nothing.
I am not afraid of snakes—” then with a touch of
Tartarin in his tone, “They never bite me.”</p>

<p>They never bit him! He who had never handled one
before—but the crowd knew nothing of this, they took it
as a statement of fact. This man, then, was a prodigy, he
handled the dreaded <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i> as a poulterer handles a
chicken. Before noon that fact had become the news of
the day in St. Pierre, and Gaspard half a hero, half a
wizard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
“All the same,” said old M. Seguin, “you have saved my
life, monsieur, but I will thank you in another place than
this—have you breakfasted? No? Well then, I pray of
you come with me and accept of my hospitality.”</p>

<p>With his hand upon Gaspard’s arm he led him away
through the crowd which divided before them, across the
Place, across the Rivière Roxelane, into the Rue Victor
Hugo.</p>

<p>Here at a café they breakfasted.</p>

<p>During the meal the old gentleman who had a strong
and vivacious personality of his own, questioned his guest
as to his past, present, and future. Though good-hearted,
evidently, and evidently a power in St. Pierre, M. Seguin
was not of the highest refinement. He shewed this in the
manner in which he cross-questioned his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i>, for at
once he had gauged Gaspard’s social position and his
manner was that of an employer standing treat to an employée,
but his every movement and every word, the tone
of his voice and the kindness in his old eyes proclaimed the
fact that he was a “straight man.”</p>

<p>Gaspard told of the wreck, and sketched his story till
he came to the name of Sagesse.</p>

<p>“Sagesse!” cried his questioner. “Pierre Sagesse?”</p>

<p>“Yes—that is his name.”</p>

<p>One might have fancied that another <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i> had
shown itself, so great was the loathing and hatred that appeared
in the face of M. Seguin. Then he smothered his
emotions and helped himself to more coffee.</p>

<p>“Beware of that man. He is not a man, he is a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de
lance</i>. Poisonous. He landed you here? Well, you will
of course have no more to do with him.”</p>

<p>Gaspard explained that he was bound to go on an expedition
with the said <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i> as soon as <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
had cleared her cargo. He said nothing of the
treasure or the object of the expedition, but I doubt if he
had, whether M. Seguin would have heard him.</p>

<p>“But you will not go.”</p>

<p>“But I must—I have given my word.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you have given your word. Well, a word given
must not be taken back even from Pierre Sagesse. But do
not get entangled with him if you can help it. Look!” He
pointed to a huge spider passing along the wall. “That is
Pierre Sagesse. He is a man-spider, who treats other men
as a spider treats flies. Gets them into his power, binds
them up, and sucks them dry. He is my greatest enemy,”
said the old man frankly enough, “and I am the only man
who has ever got the better of him. He hates me. I think
I am the only man he really hates; a nature like his does
not give itself to hate, it would be a waste of energy.” Then
suddenly, “Has he bound you?”</p>

<p>Gaspard, surprised at the question and its far-reaching
nature, was about to reply. But the old man had read the
fact in his face.</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble to say it—only this—if he has, Paul
Seguin will be your friend. Ah, you do not know Sagesse.
He has numerous poor folk here quite under his horrid
thumb, men to whom he has lent money, men whom he has
got power over, and he works them like slaves, negroes.
Well, now, when you come back from this expedition you
will stay in St. Pierre, and you will let me put you in the
way of making money. I own many of those boats that go
to the fishing. I can make you quite a comfortable place,
and you will settle amongst us and marry some pretty girl.
A fine fellow like you will have his pick of the best.”</p>

<p>Gaspard laughed. Here was a prospect if the treasure
hunt turned out fruitless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ma foi</i>,” said he. “I will take your offer righthanded.
I have never struck such a place as this, and I never hope
to leave it when I return from this voyage—and to think
that I should have the luck to meet you all through a snake.”</p>

<p>“My friend,” said M. Seguin, “there is a Martinique
proverb that says, ‘He who kills a snake is forgiven seven
deadly sins.’ So you have purged yourself of seven sins
and made a friend for life—do not let us despise snakes.”</p>

<p>For the first time Gaspard felt the pleasantness of the
fact that he had that morning saved a life. Dead Yves
appeared before him. Here was a life to balance that life
he had taken. Then in a flash appeared before him Anisette,
selling drinks at the bar of the Riga. Heavens! was
it possible that he had ever loved or thought of that tallow-faced,
under-sized creature!</p>

<p>Marie, Marie of Morne Rouge, had slain the evil shade
of Anisette in his mind, just as a sunbeam slays a shadow.</p>

<p>Then he said good-bye to M. Seguin, promising to call
and see him at the address which the old man gave him
upon a card.</p>

<p>He turned down hill to the sea front where on the Place
Bertine, amidst the sugar hogsheads, talking to one of the
port officials, he saw Sagesse. The owner of <i>La Belle
Arlésienne</i> was laughing, gesticulating and, as Gaspard
passed to emphasise some remark, he brought his great
thumb down on the top of a sugar cask.</p>

<p>Gaspard could not but remember M. Seguin’s words
about the unfortunate people under that “horrid thumb.”</p>

<span class="subhead">MARIE OF MORNE ROUGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The street of the Precipice hung literally between sea and
sky; almost as steep as a ladder, so steep that the causeway
here and there broke into flights of steps, just as a river
breaks into waterfalls. You saw, looking upwards, far
above you, the green of the high woods, and looking downwards,
far below you the harbour, blue at noon and
emerald in the morning. Nothing could be more beautiful
in its way than this old, narrow, unfashionable street
during those hours in the morning when the harbour,
gauze-green and ghostly, gazed up as through a well of
twilight at the woods, black-green against the brightening
sky.</p>

<p>Old as the time of Josephine, the street of the Precipice
held in these morning hours the twilight of romance. The
murmurs of the sea below and the woods above, the trickling
and tinkling of the gouyave water flowing down its
runnels seemed voices speaking of the past, times long
gone, women vanished, men once brave—now ghosts.</p>

<p>In the full blaze of noon, the old street shone out bright
with colours and moving with people; then, as the hour
of siesta approached, it gradually emptied, the great heat
of afternoon seemed to dry up its stream of life, the song
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">calendeuse</i> over her work, the note of a guitar,
voices from the harbour side seemed less sounds than
echoes of sound, green lizards slipped from shadow to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
shadow or basked openly in the heat. Then as the sun
declined, the old street began to speak again and live, the
sunset rushed up it like a torchbearer, setting fire to roof
and gable, yellow house wall, coloured garments of women,
up, up, lighting the woods far above—lighting the stars
and leaving them burning and leaping in the dusky blue.</p>

<p>This was the children’s hour. You could hear their
voices as they played, told their stories, sang their songs,
whilst the blue above became more dark, more definite,
more filled with stars.</p>

<p>It was here in this old street that Marie lived with
her aunt, Man’m Charles, in a house on the right as you
went up from the harbour and close to the passageway
leading to the Rue Buonaparte.</p>

<p>Born sixteen years ago up at the village of Morne
Rouge, she had paid for life the greatest payment that life
can extract from a human being. She had lost her mother.
Her father, who owned the only shop in the village, had
been fairly prosperous in a small way; besides the shop
he owned a small farm, and three times a week he would
come into the market at St. Pierre to sell his produce, leaving
the shop to the care of his sister, Ti Finotte, a woman of
forty, a woman once tall, stately, beautiful as any woman
in Martinique, but now a cripple, broken down, slain by
hard work. She had been a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i>.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i> of Martinique is a race apart; she is in
reality a peddler, selling everything from fruit to ribbons.
She carries her tray upon her head and her goods upon the
tray, and her load would break an Englishman down were
he to carry it half a dozen miles. She thinks nothing of
it. Wonderful is not the word for the work done by these
women, graceful, sometimes slightly built, often beautiful,
who, with their loads perfectly balanced, bare-footed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
dressed in clothing slight as the clothing of the ancient
Greeks, will travel fifty miles in a day from village to
village, over hill and dale, under the tropical sun, joyous
as children, pleasant, sweet to look upon, yet fated to
die at last—from overwork!</p>

<p>Yet they do not complain, nor do they look back on
their lives with bitterness; hard though the work is, it is
free from constraint of walls and houses and masters; it
is lonely passing from village to village amidst the mountains,
but they have the companionship of sun and wind
and distance. So Ti Finotte, though she was dying from
the hardships of life and though she loved little Marie,
made no opposition when Marie’s father declared his
intention of making a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i> of the child.</p>

<p>Marie was four years of age when he came to this
decision, and he came to it because he could see no better
future for her. Since the birth of Marie he had fallen
upon evil days; wishing to extend his farm, he had borrowed
money, and he had borrowed it from Sagesse, then
a rising power in St. Pierre; a bad crop and a tornado
crippled him in this new development of his business, he
had to apply to Sagesse for another loan, and from that
dated his ruin.</p>

<p>Things always worked in a diabolical manner in favour
of Sagesse: If he lent a man money something was sure
to happen to prevent that man paying the interest or
working off the debt; then, when his business had been
seized by the money-lender things would take a turn,
trade would revive, crops would be splendid—and the
benefit would fall to Sagesse.</p>

<p>It was so with the father of Marie. The year after
his property had fallen into the hands of the money-lender
a wave of prosperity passed over Martinique. He still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
lived at Morne Rouge, the paid servant of Sagesse, overseeing
the little farm that once was his own, he saw the
canes growing so heavy and so tall that the harvesters
could scarcely make way amidst them, the bananas bending
beneath the weight of their huge yellow clusters, yet
he did not grumble; it was Fate, and he made the best of
the business for himself and Marie.</p>

<p>When Marie was fifteen and old enough to begin the
business of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i>, Ti Finotte died, and Marie came to
live with the aunt in the Street of the Precipice and to act
as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i> in the employ of M. Sartine, the dealer in
foulards, ribbons, madras handkerchiefs, and women’s
apparel, whose shop was in the Rue Victor Hugo. The
death of Ti Finotte had stricken the child to the heart,
for she was still but a child despite her fifteen years and
her figure, tall, straight, supple—almost the figure of a
woman; the change from the sun-blaze of Morne Rouge to
the shadowy old street of the Precipice had seemed part
of the mournful change that had come in her life with
the death of the woman who had been a second mother
to her; her aunt, Man’m Charles, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">calendeuse</i> by trade,
was a stern woman, religious, a devotee, and without much
heart or sympathy for young people—yet in a fortnight
the girl had adapted herself to her new life and had come
to love the old street, its voices, its colours, its dimness,
and its mystery.</p>

<p>It had told her its secret. A secret that could only
be told to a poet or a child. Man’m Charles knew nothing
of this secret, the traders and hawkers, the brazier
who lived by the passageway into the Rue Buonaparte,
the baker whose shop was opposite the brazier’s, knew
nothing of it. For them it was just a street, for Marie it
was a mystery half understood. The old houses, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
shadows, the steps moss-grown and tread-worn, the twilight
of early morning, the whispering of the gouyave
water, all these spoke to her, telling her things—things
about the past, things about the future, hints of the mystery
of life—as though the people who had once lived there
and loved there had left some voice behind them, some
echo of their story.</p>

<p>Three days a week, early in the morning, just as Pelée
was showing hard against the dawn, she would leave for
M. Sartine’s, receive her tray of goods and start on her
journey, carrying it as though it were a thing of no weight.</p>

<p>To see her life and work, one must follow her as, leaving
the Rue Victor Hugo, up through the steep and twilit
streets, she passes, moving as no woman can move who
does not walk bare-footed, passing with the silence of a
ghost and the grace of Atalanta, giving good-day to every
one she meets, friends or strangers, up, up, past the Rue
Peysette, the Rue Petit Versailles, till the houses begin
to disappear and the road turns from a street to a country
road set on either side with balisiers, gigantic ferns, whispering
canes; scented with damp earth and the perfume
of the night jasmine.</p>

<p>Up here, were she to look back, she would see the city
at her feet still twilit and half asleep, the bay blue but
still filled with night, and beyond the shadow of the island,
away to the west, the sea sparkling in the sunlight.</p>

<p>But she does not look back nor turn her head. Her
eyes, ever on the watch for the dreaded <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i>, are
fixed on the roadway before her.</p>

<p>Every moment, the sky above is becoming more filled
with light, and as she climbs it seems to her that she is
climbing to the sunlight; now, the road, more level, is
turning the great shadow of Pelée, and before her the
twilight of morning is turning to the blue of day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
The road takes a sharp bend, she turns it, and she is
enveloped in a flame of sunshine, the warm blowing trade
wind which the mountains shut off from St. Pierre blows in
her face. <em>Zombis</em>, snakes, evil spirits, all the Fears that
haunt darkness, are banished by the sunlight, blown away
by the wind.</p>

<p>Away up here, so high above everything, she seems the
only person in the world; there is not a soul in sight; cane
fields, valleys, mornes, mountains purple and blue, the
dazzling azure sea—distances and colours lie before her.
Silence and sunlight.</p>

<p>She always pauses here as one pauses when one meets
a friend. The greatest poet, the meanest man, would do
the same in face of this supreme loveliness.</p>

<p>As she looks from the blue sea to the green mornes
and from the mornes to the blue mountains over which La
Trace, the great white highroad, passes like a narrow
white ribbon, she talks to it all in an undertone. She
knows nothing of where the sea leads to, she knows nothing
of the sun, or whether the earth moves round him
or he round the earth, she is ignorant of these things as the
prehistoric woman. That is perhaps why she understands it
all so well, this great picture to which she speaks in an
undertone, caressingly as a child speaks to its mother.</p>

<p>Then the road draws her back again and she passes
on with her burden on her head, walking swiftly and
easily, straight as a flame, a beautiful picture against the
whispering canes that line the road, the palmistes, and
the ferns.</p>

<p>Her journey may be as far as Grande Anse, she may
be going to sell her goods at Calabasse, at Marigot, or
Vauclin; far or near, it is all the same to her.</p>

<p>At noon, she is travelling still; across those blue hills
in the torrid light of midday you will find her passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
on her way; she has sold some of her goods, and there are
coins in the little bag at her girdle. But she is not thinking
of them. Of what is she thinking? Ah, if you were
to lead her life, always active, always in the open air,
you would know that thought can live in suspension. Not
the suspension of sleep, but of half slumber, wide awake
to all external things, yet dwelling on none especially.
She would see, as she went, the hills change as the road
turned, far mountains vanish as the road dipped, and
reappear as it rose again, distant vistas of blue sea peeping
at her between the mornes, fields of green cane waving
to the breeze, woods breaking into view; and the woods
would push the sea aside and the cane fields take the place
of the woods, and the green mornes of the cane fields, and
the sea of the mornes. So full was she of life and energy
that movement, so far from tiring her, was more pleasant
than rest, mesmerising her, lulling her, till at times it
almost seemed as though she were not moving at all,
that it was the scenery which was moving, hills, fields,
mountains, and sea, shifting, altering, giving place one
to the other to peep at her on her journey.</p>

<p>In a year she was known all over the island. The
negroes cutting the cane would pause to look at Marie
of Morne Rouge, the prettiest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i> in Martinique, and
give her good-day; at the villages where she called with
her wares, she did a better trade than any other <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i>;
her prettiness had little to do with this success, for her
customers were women, but she had a way with her, an
innocence, a sweetness, that made her pleasant as a rose.</p>

<p>Needless to say, in Martinique, where hearts are as
inflammable as tinder, she had admirers, scores, hundreds—but
she had no lover.</p>

<p>When young men came to talk to her they found themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
at a loss before this girl who spoke to them eye
to eye, frankly, freely, as a friend might speak to a
friend. She did not seem to know that she was a girl;
other girls—all the girls in St. Pierre of her age—had
lovers, visions of Love, visions of Cupids with tinsel
wings, wedding wreaths, all the frippery that goes to make
marriage the woman’s pageant. Marie had no visions
of these things. Her mind was of that rare order of
woman’s mind which holds all the love of heaven in solution,
but no image of Love till the man she is fated to
meet meets her, glances at her, speaks to her, and at a
stroke makes her his forever.</p>

<p>These are the women who are the heroines of the real
tragedies of life—and of the immortal tales of Love.</p>

<span class="subhead">FATE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One day, M. Sartine sent Marie to call at a house on
the highroad that leads across the Morne Parnasse. Her
business was to shew some lace to a Spanish lady, Señora
Vigil, and to sell it if possible.</p>

<p>The Señora had come to Martinique by chance; she
had taken this house—the Château Principe—by chance,
and yesterday she had entered M. Sartine’s shop by chance
to buy some lace. She might just as easily have gone to
the shop of M. Custine, or to the Fleur d’Avril, or to
the Bon Marché, but chance—whose other name is Fate—led
her into the shop of M. Sartine.</p>

<p>Marie, who had sold the whole quantity of lace to the
Señora, was returning to St. Pierre well pleased and
in high spirits. It was her sixteenth birthday and it had
brought her the pleasantest surprise in the world.</p>

<p>Finotte, Dodotte, Florine, Honorine, all her girl friends
and acquaintances, had remembered the day; each had
brought a little present, a trifle, less than a trifle, a box
of sea shells blazing with colour, a scarf, a string of
beads—the brazier across the way and the baker, had
remembered her; they did not bring presents, but they
called out good wishes as she passed. Her aunt gave her
the rarest thing she ever gave to anyone—a smile. She
had not known that any of these people had cared for
her till this morning, when her birthday made them speak.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
And she had told no one of her birthday, or only one
girl, Finotte—she must have spread the news.</p>

<p>Then, she had been entrusted with the lace selling by
M. Sartine, a most important business, in which she had
succeeded. The Señora had spoken kindly to her, asked
her her age, and discovering that it was her birthday, had
given her a little old-fashioned cross wrought in silver
and with the blessed Saviour upon it. “It has been
blessed by the Archbishop of Santa Cruz,” said the Señora,
“and whilst you keep it nothing evil can hurt you.”</p>

<p>It had been a wonderful morning. The sun was full
in the sky as she came along the road past the Jardin
des Plantes. The gates were open, they were always
open, rusty and gone to decay; she could see in through
the great arch of twilight made by the trees. In there
amidst the palms and great tropical trees a bird was
singing, calling, filling the echoes with its golden, flute-like
notes. It was a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">siffleur de montagne</i>. She paused
and looked in. The great garden, once carefully tended,
had gone to decay, the lianas hung like ropes between
the trees; palmiste and tree fern, cedar and locust, all
were roped and tangled by the lianas, the scent of vanilla
came on the air from the green gloom, vanilla, and green
orange, wet mould, the sad odour of decaying leaves.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful and mysterious place, the Jardin
des Plantes; laid out when Versailles was filled with
courtiers, beautiful when Josephine, not yet an empress,
walked its paths, nothing dreaming of Napoleon or her
fate; long gone to decay and given over now to Nature,
who was slowly taking it back to herself.</p>

<p>Marie, when she passed the gates, always looked in
fascinated and half frightened at the silent riot of trees
and shrubs; but to-day it seemed less gloomy; the voice
of the bird seemed to fill it with light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
“Marie! Marie! Marie! <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bonjour</i>, Marie—Marie de
Morne Rouge,” sang the bird. She made a lovely picture
as she stood in the sunlit road, listening with a half
smile to the liquid golden notes of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">siffleur de montagne</i>.</p>

<p>“Marie! Marie! Marie! <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bonjour</i>, Marie—Marie de
Morne Rouge.”</p>

<p>Then she sighed, turned, and passed on her way. It
was as though the old garden where lovers had walked
in days gone by had told her something, just as the old
street of the Precipice had told her something. But what
the garden told her was far less understandable; something
new and strange and sad had spoken in the voice
of the bird, in the silence of the green gloom. It was
as though she had seen the vision of some lovely country,
unattainable, a moment glimpsed, and then gone forever.</p>

<p>But she came through the Place du Fort and across the
bridge spanning the Rivière Roxelane.</p>

<p>The washerwomen below were busy; she could hear
their voices and their laughter; the Rue Victor Hugo was
filled with people; she knew many of them, sister <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuses</i>,
shop-keepers, idlers, and gave them good-day as she
passed.</p>

<p>The crowd was thinner as she drew near the little
Place de la Fontaine, and she could see the water of the
fountain like a diamond flower in the sunshine. As she
was crossing the Place she saw a figure in white clothes
coming towards her. Her eye, keen and trained to observation,
noted at once that this was some stranger to St.
Pierre, some man from the foreign ships, no Creole.</p>

<p>As she passed him, she looked him straight in the face,
frankly, just as she looked everyone in the face, man or
woman; his eyes met her eyes full, lit up, and—she had
passed on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
The crowd was around her, but she did not see it.
Someone had spoken to her without words; she had spoken
to someone. The world for a moment seemed empty of
people, containing only herself and that mysterious someone.
She scarcely remembered his face except that it was
dark, and vaguely good-looking; but the eyes held her
soul. He had spoken to her as a man speaks to a woman
with a glance; that was nothing compared with the fact
that she had spoken to him. It was as though something
dumb in her, something of which she had never suspected
the existence, had awoken from sleep, escaped from darkness,
spoken in a strange language, and then sank back
to darkness, leaving her bewildered and astonished.</p>

<p>For a moment as she went on her way the vision of
the Jardin des Plantes rose before her, and the voice of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">siffleur de montagne</i> followed her: “Marie! Marie!
Marie! Marie de Morne Rouge.” The old love-haunted
garden and the bird seemed trying to tell her something—something
impossible to understand, something beyond
all sadness sad, and beyond all beauty beautiful.</p>

<p>Then, drowning out everything, as though some belfry
in the sky had flung open, came the sound of bells; it was
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carillon</i> of the cathedral that rings twice daily, silver
bells and golden bells, tenor and alto, answered by a
thousand singing echoes from high wood and harbour, street
and place, floating up to the blue sky, floating out over
the blue sea.</p>

<p>“Marie, Marie de Morne Rouge—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bonjour</i>, Marie—Little
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i>, child of the sun, listen to us, the bells, listen
to us, the echoes—we are speaking the language he spoke,
birds and echoes, bells and flowers, soul of woman and
soul of man, one language only have they.”</p>

<p>“Marie de Morne Rouge—Marie.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span class="subhead">THE FLEUR D’AMOUR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Then, as if challenged by the bells, the clouds around
Pelée spread out fanwise, the sky darkened, and Marie,
taking shelter beneath a verandah, heard the rush of rain
as it swept down from street to street.</p>

<p>The darkness and the rain were like an omen—or might
have been but for the bells, ringing on, joyous, triumphant,
like the love that lives through disaster and beyond
death.</p>

<p>She heard the thunder of the rain on roof and verandah,
the sky looked as though it would never clear again, and
then, just as though the bells had broken a way to heaven,
a blue rift shewed through the clouds, widened, spread
wider still to a burst of sunshine and the clouds were
passing away over the sea, sweeping it with meadows of
tourmaline-coloured shadow.</p>

<p>Marie, leaving the shelter of the verandah, turned to
the shop of M. Sartine, gave the account of her dealings
with the Señora, received her meed of praise from the old
shopkeeper, who was an excellent-hearted man in all
things in which money was not concerned, and departed
for home.</p>

<p>As she left the shop and entered the Rue Victor Hugo,
the world seemed commonplace again, the bells had ceased
ringing, the joyous morning had passed away as if the
voices of the bells had carried it away out to sea with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
She returned to the Street of the Precipice. Man’m
Charles was in a bad humour; Finotte, one of the girls
whom she employed in her business, had not turned up that
morning and she was short-handed. The ill-temper which
ought to have fallen to Finotte fell on Marie.</p>

<p>It is always just so in this world, the day that begins
cloudless, warm, and perfect, rarely lasts till sunset.</p>

<p>The girl who was never for a moment idle took the place
of Finotte, one might have thought that working as she did
at the trade of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i> a holiday might have fallen to her
occasionally on such a day as this, but she did not grumble.</p>

<p>She set to work painting the great madras handkerchief
without a murmur.</p>

<p>Three other girls were working in the room with her, a
dim room into which the blazing sunshine of the street outside
scarcely penetrated through the green slats of the
shutters. Pauline, Celestine, and Florine were their names,
and they chatted as they worked in the sweet childish
French of the tropics. It was like the chatting of birds
in a dimly lit cage. Celestine was to be married next
month, Pauline and Florine had lovers, Love, marriage,
other girls’ lovers, heart-affairs, Rosine jilted by the fisherman
Ambrose, who had gone to live at Fort de France,
Lys who had jilted Achille, who had threatened to drown
himself—so the conversation ran on. Birds one might
imagine talking like this, one to the other in the branches
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">loseille bois</i> and the tamarinds. Marie took no part
in the conversation, she never did when the talk ran like
this. To-day as she worked, she seemed even more abstracted
than usual. But she was listening—half listening,
wondering why Lys had jilted Achille, why the fisherman
Ambrose had jilted Rosine, interested in the troubles of
these people, though she could not tell why. Yesterday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
their squabblings would have been quite uninteresting to
her.</p>

<p>Then as she worked, she saw things. The road over the
Morne de Parnasse, the green gloom of the Jardin des
Plantes, the sun-stricken Place du Fort, the Rue Victor
Hugo and the Place de la Fontaine with the diamond flower
of the fountain glittering in the sun.</p>

<p>Wherever her thoughts might lead her, they always
strayed back to the Place de la Fontaine. Then she would
see a white figure coming towards her. Her thoughts would
try to escape, to turn back—impossible, they had to go on,
meet face to face that someone, meet again that gaze, answer
it—then only might she pass on to lose herself in the
crowd, to meet the music of the bells, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carillon</i> of joy;
voices from the woods, echoes from the harbour side, music
from heaven, echoes from earth, clasping her, folding her
in waves of <span class="locked">sound—</span></p>

<p>Just as the waves of a tropic sea breaking on the shores
of an islet may tell to a man the fact of man’s isolation
and loneliness—loneliness that love alone can banish—so
the waves of sound, brilliant, dim, sonorous or echo-broken,
had told Marie the fact of woman’s isolation and loneliness.</p>

<p>All her life suddenly appeared to her as a great loneliness.
It was as though she were standing on the shore of an
islet and had suddenly discovered the fact for the first time
that she was utterly alone, the discovery being brought to
her by the glimpse of a far-off ship, a momentary vision
that had vanished, leaving her to her loneliness.</p>

<p>That is how real love first comes, analyse it to its depths,
that tremendous wave which strikes all human beings at
some time of their life, the crest may be sunlit, joyous,—but
the heart is from the great ocean where loneliness is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
supreme. Lifted on the joyous crest, a man sees the object
of his desire, the companion of his soul; if he does not
seize her, he will sink into the heart of the wave, the gloom
of its loneliness, to be carried to the shore at last without
ever seeing the true sunlight again.</p>

<p>After dark, when the stars were out and the voices of
the children playing in the streets had ceased, Marie went
to her room, a room so poorly furnished that one might
almost say it was not furnished at all. Just a mattress on
the floor, a chair, a box of cedar wood where she kept her
clothes and her few possessions, and on the wall a little
shrine to the Virgin, a tiny thing, gaudily painted, and
with a little trough to hold flowers.</p>

<p>She had been brought up in the Catholic faith, she placed
flowers in the little trough of the shrine and prayed to the
Virgin, but I doubt if her faith was more than a fetish
worship of the image of the Virgin, or if her religion gave
her any comfort in bad times.</p>

<p>Ti Finotte had died and gone away into the darkness, the
smiling Virgin in the little shrine could not stop that or
say one word of comfort. In her heart of hearts, she felt
religion to be an entirely one-sided affair wherein Man
did everything from good works to worship and the Deity
nothing. But then she was only Marie, a being come from
very far away. Her people had given the Caribbean Sea
its name, had hunted the wild horses before our Saviour
was born, were lost to sight behind centuries of sunlight,
and silence, and savagery. How could she see clearly the
light, with the dawn of the world still in her eyes?</p>

<p>She went to bed and to the dreamless sleep that comes
to the hard worker whose work lies in the open air. Next
morning she was up before the stars had paled, for her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
aunt had set her several tasks to do before breakfast time.</p>

<p>Amongst other things, she had to go to the market to buy
provisions, and it was there, you will remember, that she
had her second meeting with Gaspard, and his gift of the
fleur d’amour.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ROAD TO GRANDE ANSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Next morning very early Marie made her way to the Rue
Victor Hugo, received her tray of goods, and started on her
journey. It was a long journey to-day, right away to
Grande Anse on the eastern side of the island.</p>

<p>She passed up the steep twilit streets, up, up, past the
Rue Petit Versailles, till the houses broke up and the way
began to turn from a street to a country road.</p>

<p>Just here she did what she had never done before, turned
and looked down at the city steeped in twilight.</p>

<p>With the heavy load of the tray she dared not bend her
head. She stood with head erect and eyes cast down, beautiful
and statuesque as one of the Greek Caniphori. She
was thinking, “Ah, there is someone there, in what house is
he, in which street, is he awake yet or does he still sleep?”</p>

<p>Then, raising her eyes, she looked far over the sea,
bright beyond the shadow of Pelée and the hills. She was
thinking, “He came from there—where from beyond that
wonderful bright sea did he come?” The sea had always
been one of the mysteries of her life, and the ships that
came from away beyond the horizon.</p>

<p>Then she turned and resumed her way along the twilit
road filled with the early morning scent of tropical woods
and flowers, she had forgotten her fear of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i>.
<em>Zombis</em> and evil shapes had vanished from her path—those
shadows of the mind that have no existence when forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Yesterday, when she was leaving the market, she had
heard the screams of the market-women and had turned to
see <em>him</em> surrounded with people. He had killed the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de
lance</i> with his naked hand; snakes could do him no harm,
so the market people had said. That fact made the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de
lance</i> less fearful to her. He did not fear it, why should
she? In this tropical mind, sealed so long to love, Love had
suddenly disclosed himself full grown and statuesque.</p>

<p>It was as though in a tropical garden gone to a state of
nature, some wind had pushed the foliage aside revealing
the marble form of the garden god, the statue that had
been there since the garden was planted first, lurking
amidst the leaves, and now seen for the first time. As she
turned the shadow of Pelée, the sunlight struck her, and
the view lay spread as of old. The wonderful view of
Martinique, its hills, and mountains, its fields of cane, and
visions of distant sea.</p>

<p>She paused, as she always paused just here, to feel the
trade wind and the warmth of the sun. There lay the
mountains she had known from childhood with La Trace,
the white highroad, winding away across them, the mornes,
the valleys, the glimpse of the distant sea towards Fort de
France. It seemed to her that she was looking at all this
for the first time. The world, since yesterday, had become
new, a spirit, half gay, half sad, had infused itself into
everything, the hills, the sea, the distance—the world, since
yesterday, would never be the same again to Marie of
Morne Rouge.</p>

<p>The last time she had passed along that road, she had
travelled without thought, careless as a child, free as a bird—now
it was all different. She could not tell in the least
what had happened to her, she never connected the change
with love, the thing Finotte and Pauline chattered about so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
glibly. She only knew that the great old hills were speaking
a new language to her and that Distance had become
Loneliness.</p>

<p>She had travelled the white highroad many a time alone,
yet she had never felt herself alone till to-day.</p>

<p>Then, as she went on her way along the road blazing in
the sun and set on either side with palmistes, tree ferns,
bushes of grenadilla blossom and sun-stricken tamarinds, a
voice said to her:</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bonjour, mademoiselle.</i>”</p>

<p>There was no one but herself upon the road, nothing
moving but the shadows of the palm fronds shaken by the
wind and the green lizards slipping across the dust in the
sunlight. It was the voice of yesterday.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bonjour, mademoiselle.</i>”</p>

<p>She called it up again and again and made it repeat the
words, then she recalled his face as she had seen it when
glancing up at him to thank him for the flower.</p>

<p>She had a companion now.</p>

<p>Had you seen her passing, swift, silently, with her burden
poised on her head, straight as a palmiste, enveloped
in a flame of sunlight, with her luminous eyes gazing
straight into the distance before her, you might have fancied
her a somnambulist, a person walking in a dream—she
was.</p>

<p>As she went on her way, she experienced a new sensation,
it was as though St. Pierre had attached itself to her
by a thread, the further she went, the tighter did this thread
grow—“Come back” said St. Pierre, “every step you take,
takes you away from him, come back, you do not know, he
is a foreign sailor and may be carried away in one of those
mysterious ships, those ships that spread their sails and
pass away beyond the blue horizon to be lost forever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
It was up on the Morne du Midi that the voice of St.
Pierre said this to her for the first time. She paused. The
sun was high and pouring a torrent of light on sea and land.</p>

<p>The sun rays seemed beaten back from the earth, rising
in a vague and dazzling spray as the water of a torrent
rises in a spray-cloud. The hills were indefinite, blue, and
purple shapes, the sea had lost its horizon and seemed part
of the sky and the woods of the Morne du Midi were as
still as death. Nothing sings or stirs in the West Indian
woods when the sun is holding the world like this.</p>

<p>Marie, on the highest summit of the Morne, stood as
though the silence of the world had suddenly stricken her,
taking away movement and life.</p>

<p>“Ah, if he were to leave St. Pierre! If she were to
return and never find him again!”</p>

<p>She had only seen him twice, she had only spoken to him
a word, were he to pass out of her life forever, it would be
the passing away of a spectre, a mist, a dream, but she
would never love again. It was as though she had been
waiting for him since the beginning of the world, as though
she had lived through the remote past, through the old
Carib days, passing from re-incarnation to re-incarnation,
through the fervour of tropical days and nights, the silences
of the tropical forests, without finding him. And now that
she had found him, how would it be with her if she lost
him?</p>

<p>Her mind, absolutely virgin and frank as the mind of
the prehistoric woman, never paltered with words, she
stood there on the morne, gazing at the vision of deathless
love, supreme and mysterious happiness, torn by the
thought—“Ah, should I lose it!”</p>

<p>There were still miles before her to be travelled before
she reached Grande Anse, St. Pierre was calling her back,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
all her soul and being craved to return; few women of
Europe could have withstood that call of the heart, she had
only to return, to wander through the streets, by the harbour,
on the Place Bertine, and she would be almost sure
to meet him; but she had a trust to fulfil, the goods she
was carrying had to be delivered at Grande Anse, Death
might have stopped but would not have prevented her in
her endeavour to fulfil her trust, and Love was powerless
over her in this simple matter as Death.</p>

<p>That was her character drawn in four lines. Capable
of immortal passion, yet bound by a simple duty as matter
is bound by gravity.</p>

<p>Then she went on her road due east for Grande Anse,
past the silent woods, through the great white light of the
day.</p>

<span class="subhead">THEY MEET</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Grand Anse is just a little town, gone rather to decay, on
a cliff forever swept by the sun and the trade wind.</p>

<p>It is the most lonely place in the world and the most
quaint.</p>

<p>At St. Pierre, on the west side of the island, the sea is
deep and still, morning comes late because of the shadow
of the mountains, and the sunset blazes up the streets like
a conflagration. The first rays of sunlight touch Grande
Anse, morning rushes on the town across great wastes of
violet-coloured sea; the dawns are immense here, what
you see is the lighting up of a world; on the one side, all
the world of ocean quivering and leaping in light, on the
other, all the island world. Mountains springing to life
against a sky still showing a trace of stars, the cloud turban
of Pelée, first a luminous haze like some vast nebula
just born, then a burning fleece of gold. Then, just as
though the shadows of night were a garment unloosed and
let slip, the great mountain undrapes itself and stands a
cone of emerald green, a pyramid of colour in the blue
and voiceless sky.</p>

<p>St. Pierre is still in shadow, but the whole eastward side
of the island is burning in the sun. St. Pierre has its
feet in the Caribbean Sea, but Grande Anse is washed by
the Atlantic. The south equatorial current and the trade
wind keep the shore forever booming with waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Marie, as she came along the national road, could hear
the sea like the breathing of a vast shell, before the first
houses of the town came in sight. She entered the main
street, which is a continuation of the road, stopped at the
shop of M. Carbet, an old sun-dried Creole trader, who
could remember the time when Grande Anse was prosperous
with sugar mills and plantations worked under the old
regime of slavery. M. Carbet inspected the goods sent him
by M. Sartine, loaded the tray with other goods to be
returned, and invited the girl to sit down and rest and
have some refreshment.</p>

<p>When she had rested herself, having still an hour before
she would start on her return to St. Pierre, she left the old
man to take his siesta and came out to look at the sea.</p>

<p>Always, when she came to Grande Anse, she would, if
she had time, come to the cliff edge to look at the sea.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful sight, for the emerald waves come racing
in on a soot-black beach. Nowhere else is there a beach
like that or such curious colour effects; white foam, white
gulls, blue sea, curving emerald waves, black sand. Over
all the sunlight and the boom of the water.</p>

<p>As she stood, the trade wind blowing in her face and
fluttering her robe, she saw by the sea edge two white figures,
the figure of an old man and a young man.</p>

<p>The old man was M. Seguin, the young man was Gaspard.</p>

<p>M. Seguin, who had a house at Grand Anse and who lived
there the greater part of the year, finding the climate much
more invigorating and far less rainy than the climate of
St. Pierre, had met Gaspard yesterday evening, after having
parted with him in the forenoon, and the inspiration
came to him to invite his new-found friend to Grande
Anse. They had driven over and Gaspard was to return
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
And away up on the Morne du Midi, Marie, quite unknowing
the interest that Fate was taking in her affairs,
had struggled against the impulse to return to St. Pierre.
Duty had won its struggle against Love, yet Love had
gained his end. It was as though some subtle strategy had
been working behind the face of things.</p>

<p>She recognized the two figures instantly, she caught her
breath—“It is He!”</p>

<p>Almost as she sighted them, the two men began to turn
their steps from the sea edge, and the first thing that struck
their eyes was the gem-like figure on the little cliff outlined
against the burning blue of the sky.</p>

<p>M. Seguin, despite his sixty years, was as keen-sighted
as his companion. He recognized the girl instantly, he had
spoken to her often. The prettiest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i> in Martinique
had no greater admirer than M. Seguin.</p>

<p>He raised his stick by way of salutation and she on the
cliff raised her hand.</p>

<p>Then she waited as the two men came across the black
sand of the beach and began to climb the cliff path. She
had no false modesty, she did not palter with the truth, the
being her soul craved to meet was ascending the cliff path
and she waited to meet him, without a tremor or blush or
pretence of turning away.</p>

<p>“It is Marie of Morne Rouge, La Petite Marie,” said the
old man (as if Gaspard did not know), “the prettiest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i>
in the island and the best girl—but <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tenez</i>, I will
shew her to you.”</p>

<p>The sun shewed her to him. The sun had taken her
little, perfectly-shaped head between his great golden hands
and was raining kisses on her forehead, her face, her neck,
her feet; the sea wind was fluting and folding her striped
robe, which, caught up at the waist, exposed her perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
formed ankles; she might have been a Greek girl on the
sea cliffs of Latmos, Troy might still have been a city and
Hector a living hero, so far removed from present times did
she seem. Only, no Greek girl could have boasted those
eyes dark and luminous, eyes that held in their depths
some trace of the gloom of the tropic forests.</p>

<p>“Ah, Marie,” cried the old man, “petite Marie—see, I
have got a friend with me, see, what do you think of him,
hey, Marie—? He is the snake-killer, the man who does
not fear the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i>, he saved a man yesterday from
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i>, yes, and that man was Paul Seguin. Me.
Yes, one does not forget that.”</p>

<p>The girl was standing, as the old man chattered on, looking
up under her arched eyebrows in a most charming
way, half evasively, with a half smile; she had met Gaspard
with a glance of recognition and now she stood like
this, scarcely looking at him, yet still looking at him,
scarcely seeming to hear the old man, yet hearing him,
smiling at his words, yet seeming to smile through the veil
of some mysterious thought.</p>

<p>Gaspard, fascinated, looked at her; she seemed a being
elusive, scarcely real; as though she had slipped through
some crystal doorway in the air to stand in the blue porch
in the sunlight for a moment. Half child, half woman,
half spirit, half human being—indeterminate as a dream.</p>

<p>“Oh, thou art pretty—thou art sweet.”</p>

<p>He recalled her words spoken to the fleur d’amour.</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on the old man, “one does not forget that—a
live <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i> with death on the tip of its tongue,
and he killed it with his naked hand—give him thy hand.
Marie, for the love of Paul Seguin, who knew thy father
when he was prosperous and before he fell into the hands
of that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i>, Pierre Sagesse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
She came forward like a child and placed her little hand
in the broad palm of Gaspard. Since the day before when
she had thanked him with a glance for the flower, she had
been filling his thoughts. From the first moment when he
met her in the little Place de la Fontaine, she had been
filling his thoughts; he was direct in love as in hate, a man
without any of the false refinement of society, but he was
a man and now, as he held her hand in his, for the first
time in his life he felt abashed, timorous as a woman,
awkward as a boy.</p>

<p>He had spoken to her bravely enough on the Place du
Fort when he had given her the flower, but now it was different,
the touch of her hand, the glance of her eyes, filled
him with confusion.</p>

<p>She, on the other hand, was calm and confident, and had
some observer been present, more keen-eyed than M. Seguin
to the delicacies of expression, he would have read
in her face something of triumph.</p>

<p>His confusion told her all, told her that she had been
in his thoughts, told her of his attitude of mind towards
her—It was homage without words.</p>

<p>When he released her hand M. Seguin took him by the
arm and they turned from the sea, Marie walking with
them in the direction of M. Seguin’s house.</p>

<p>It was a low, frame building, the best house in the town,
set round with a garden where the tamarinds and the tree
ferns all had a bend towards the west as though warped
by the eternally blowing trade wind.</p>

<p>“And you are going back to St. Pierre, Marie?” asked
the old man when they reached the gate.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Oui, Missie.</i>”</p>

<p>“Walking all the way?”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Oui, Missie.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
“Well, good luck to thee and a safe journey, ah, that I
had thy youth and strength—”</p>

<p>He was turning to the gate when Gaspard, with a half
glance at the girl, said: “I too, am returning to St. Pierre,
would Mademoiselle object to my walking with her on the
road; it is a lonely road—”</p>

<p>“You,” said the old man, before Marie could speak.
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon Dieu</i>, do you think that you could keep up with a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i>?”</p>

<p>Gaspard glanced at Marie and smiled, shewing his white
teeth, the question seemed absurd, contrasting his strong
form with the girl’s slight figure. Marie was also smiling.
Their eyes met for a second.</p>

<p>“I will try—If Mademoiselle does not object to so feeble
a companion.”</p>

<p>M. Seguin laughed, not without a touch of grim humour,
but he offered no further opposition. Instead, he accompanied
them to the shop of M. Carbet where the girl had
left her tray.</p>

<p>M. Carbet, himself, helped to put it on her head and
stood with M. Seguin watching them as they departed.</p>

<p>It was a little after two o’clock and the white national
road lay before them, balisiers, palmistes, tamarinds on
either side and fields of bending cane. The island before
them leaping up to the sky in great bouquets of happy
colour, purple and blue and mauve of mountain, black-blues
and green of ravine and morne: above all, Pelée, with
his turban of cloud. One might have imagined that some
giant in play had put gum on Pelée’s head and a tuft of
cotton wool on the gum.</p>

<p>It was the only cloud in the blue sky, and as they walked,
some wind, suddenly born in the upper air, began to play
with it so that it seemed to fume and rise like smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
It gave them something to talk about. He found it very
difficult to follow what she said, speaking as she did, in
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">patois</i> of the island and this difficulty in understanding
one another gave them something to laugh about so that
soon they were like two good companions almost forgetting,
for a moment, the mysterious attraction that had drawn
them one towards the other. At times she would seem to
forget him, the old mesmerism of the road would seize her,
the mesmerism of distance and light, the rock-a-bye of
movement; she would hum to herself as though she were
alone, once she put words to the tune, it was an old Creole
song, simple, and sorrowful; she only sang a few bars and
then remembering that her companion was beside her,
ceased. She had not forgotten him for a moment, she was
singing to him in her mind, but she had half forgotten the
fact that he was listening in the flesh.</p>

<p>She was happy, entirely happy. He was beside her.
She knew nothing more of love than that, two birds flying
forever side by side through the blue sky, that was her
dim conception of love, two beings accompanying each
other through life just as now, he and she were accompanying
each other along the national road, what more
could one want?</p>

<p>They passed over mornes and through valleys, following
the great white road; they were cutting canes in the fields
and the negroes looked after Marie of Morne Rouge accompanied
by a man, she had found a mate at last.</p>

<p>They called after her, but what they said was swallowed
up, dissolved in the langourous air of afternoon, it seemed
like voices coming across the fields of dreamland. A <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">siffleur
de montagne</i>, singing in the woods of balisier, sent its bell-like
notes to follow them.</p>

<p>On the Morne du Midi they paused. The world and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
far off sea swam in a golden haze, the mountains were blue
cloud shapes, vague purple cones; nothing was definite but
the peak of Pelée, now stripped entirely of cloud and
standing shrill in the blue. Then they passed on, following
the road as it dipped into the valley and rose again
over the Morne d’Avril.</p>

<p>It was now that Gaspard remembered M. Seguin’s
words: “You can never keep pace with a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i>.” The
girl beside him, laden though she was with the heavy tray,
seemed to move without effort, swift, and silent as a cloud
shadow. He was beginning to tire, but he would not give
in. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon Dieu</i>,” thought he, “to be outwalked by a girl.
I would die first.”</p>

<p>To hide his weariness he began to sing. He had a good
voice and he sent <i>The Girls of Avignon</i> across the cane
fields, floating on the warm wind of afternoon, so that the
cane cutters paused in their work to listen. Marie had
never heard a song like that, though she only half-caught
the meaning of the words it seemed to open new vistas
before her. This was one of the songs from the land he
came from, joyous and strange, far different from the
Creole songs that are all set to the same key—Melancholy.</p>

<p>He sang <i>Jean François de Nantes</i>, and the topsail-haul
chanty of the French merchant service, songs strange as
sea gulls amidst these green mornes and waving cane fields.</p>

<p>The sun was well in the west now, casting his light full
in their faces, their shadows stretched far back along the
white road, the valleys between the mornes were beginning
to fill with shadow, shadow that, like some blue luminous
fluid, would fill them to the brim, overflow, and flood the
mornes, the fields, and the road.</p>

<p>“I would sooner die than give in,” that was the real
burthen of the songs with which he tried to give himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
heart, his head ached, his limbs ached, he would have given
half he possessed to cast himself down amidst the green
stuff on the roadside—yet she kept on as fresh as when
she started, listening to his songs, chatting, saying things
that he only half understood, singing, sometimes, herself,
when he ceased—what a girl!—it was as though a man
had matched himself against an immortal.</p>

<p>Here and there along the road were shrines to the Virgin
and occasionally a fountain fed by one of the innumerable
little streams from the hills.</p>

<p>They had passed the Morne de la Croix when, by one of
these wayside fountains, his determination to die before
giving in left him. There was a green bank by the fountain,
huge tree ferns grew above the bank and in the shadow
of their fronds the fountain water, escaping from a lion’s
head carved in stone, sang, and whispered forever to the
ferns.</p>

<p>He sat down on the bank and Marie standing before him,
saw for the first time the true state of affairs. She took
the little flask of ratifia which the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i> always carried
and a cup from her girdle, put some of the ratifia in the
cup, filled it with water and gave it to him.</p>

<p>He drank it off. It was like drinking life. Then she
pointed to the tray on her head and asked him to help her
to remove it.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i>, once loaded, cannot remove the heavy
tray from her head without help. She dare not bend her
neck lest it should be dislocated by the weight.</p>

<p>He rose and helped her, she placed the tray by the road
and then sat down on the bank beside him. Ah, how good
it was to rest in the cool shadow of the ferns, his tiredness
cast from him like a dropped cloak.</p>

<p>He almost forgot that the being beside him was a girl.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
It was as if he were sitting beside a good companion after
a long journey; after four hours in the stokehold he had
often felt the same, resting for a moment with Yves on the
engine-room hatch.</p>

<p>Great exertion often leaves the mind clear to perception:
the passions, desires, and craving of life are stilled and
over the resting body the mind floats clear of perception,
lazy, alive to feeling, but half dead to thought.</p>

<p>He took his pipe from his pocket—the same pipe he had
been smoking beneath the palm trees that day when Yves,
returning from the north of the islet had flung the crabs
beside him on the sand—filled it and lit it, whilst
Marie, beside him, her hands folded and resting upon her
knees, sat, her eyes gazing at the road before her yet
seeming not to see it.</p>

<p>These fits of abstraction were characteristic of her,
caused perhaps, partly by her business in life, partly by
her nature.</p>

<p>It was as though the far off mountains, the blue distances,
the visions of remote sea that made her everyday
horizon, followed her through life and every now and then
closed in around her, separating her for the moment from
her fellow beings.</p>

<p>She seemed now to have forgotten the existence of
Gaspard, then, a field rat from the canes scuttled across
the road and the sight of it brought her back from her
reverie, she shuddered, then she gave a little laugh, drew
her robe tightly round her, and drew up her little naked
feet under her robe.</p>

<p>“Ahn—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voici</i> Missie Sagesse—ah, did you see him—more
crafty than the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i>.” With head half
turned she was watching the grass still vibrating where
Missie Sagesse had whisked in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Gaspard laughed, the great fat field rat—and the West
Indian field rat is the cunningest thing in nature, and
looks it—did carry with it a suggestion of the Captain.</p>

<p>He had forgotten Sagesse, <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>, and the
forthcoming expedition, for the moment.</p>

<p>“Sagesse,” said he, “what do you know about Captain
Sagesse, little one?”</p>

<p>She cast her eyes up and made a movement with her
hand. One of the charming things about her was the way
she could speak without speaking, just by a gesture, a
glance, she could tell things that would take many words
to say. Her up-cast eyes and the movement she made with
her hand told the character of the Captain without speech.</p>

<p>She nodded towards the long grass where the rat had
disappeared: “He hides amidst the canes, he kills the little
birds that cannot yet fly, he comes to the henroosts of the
poor people and kills the little chickens—egg-sucker—ahn—of
all things the meanest. Once—” said Marie, leaving
description for romance “a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i> bit him.”</p>

<p>“Did he die?”</p>

<p>“No, it was the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i> who died.” She laughed.
Voltaire, sitting in his study at Ferney had once made the
same jest about the man who poisoned the snake. Goldsmith
used the same idea with a dog for the chief protagonist
of his story. She had never heard of Voltaire or Goldsmith—she
just wanted to describe Sagesse.</p>

<p>Then she rose to her feet and pointed to her shadow
strewn away down the road, then to the sun nearing the
mountain tops. It was time to be going, and Gaspard, rising,
helped her to lift the heavy tray to her head.</p>

<p>Already it was cooler, the great haze of afternoon light
had faded and distant things were becoming definite, the
sun was fast approaching the mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
“You know this Sagesse—” said Gaspard as he walked
beside her, “well I know him too. I am going with him
soon on a voyage.”</p>

<p>She stopped and turned, facing him fully. “Going with
him—a voyage.”</p>

<p>“Not far—I will return.”</p>

<p>“Going with him—ah, you are going with him—”</p>

<p>“I will return.”</p>

<p>The trouble in her face and voice affected him strangely.
He did not know how Sagesse had entered into her life
before this, ruining her father, casting a blight on her
home. Sagesse was to her like an evil spirit. She had
seen his blight on many people, he had blighted her own
life once and now his shadow had fallen across her path
again, he was taking Gaspard away.</p>

<p>Gaspard took her unresisting hand.</p>

<p>“I have promised to go with him, but I will return.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you have promised—”</p>

<p>That was final. With her, a promise once given was
binding as a thing accomplished.</p>

<p>“And when?”</p>

<p>“We will not go for some weeks.”</p>

<p>He was still holding her hand; as yet they had said no
word of love, yet they stood like a pair of lovers about to
part, her trouble had communicated itself in some subtle
way to him. The very air around them seemed suddenly
filled with sadness, it was the light which was beginning
to fade.</p>

<p>The sun had half descended behind the mountains, cut
in two by the sharp edge of the hills; what remained of
him was still furiously alive, palpitating, and seeming to
fight against fate; but the valleys between the mornes were
now filled with shadow and over-brimming, dusk was rising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
like a tide, waves of violet shadow passing over the landscape.
Behind them, had they turned to look, they would
have seen the ghost of a moon in the lilac of the eastern
sky.</p>

<p>St. Pierre would soon be in the full blaze of sunset, there
were miles still to be travelled, she gently released her
hand, turned, and they passed on. They did not say a
word but in that moment of sadness, hand in hand, the
future of the one had become a part of the future of the
other. He was hers and she was his.</p>

<p>Never had love come to mortals in a more idyllic fashion,
speechless, through the fading light, there on the white
road with the straight palms for only witness.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<span class="subhead">FLOWER OF LIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When they passed through Morne Rouge the last rays
of sunset were flaming up the streets of St. Pierre and the
light of the moon in her first quarter was beginning to
flood the world. They had still some miles to go and now
their shadow lay before them, dimly sketched on the road
by the strengthening moonlight. At the approach of night
the air had become filled with sound. The woods were
beginning to awake. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cabritt bois</i>, the great beetles
that boom amidst the tamarinds, the thousand insects of
the night were tuning up, the fireflies were drifting in
clouds above the grenadilla blossoms and, now, as though a
door had been suddenly shut, night filled the world and
the stars the sky. When they reached the turn of the road
leading down to St. Pierre Gaspard paused.</p>

<p>Beneath them lay the city sprayed with lights, the bay
touched with starlight, and beyond the shadow of the mountains
the sea in the light of the moon.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said he, “I must meet you again to-morrow—where
shall I meet you, and when?”</p>

<p>She stood for a moment without answering. To-morrow
she would have to go to Calabasse far away towards Pelée
and beyond Morne Rouge. The eternal labour to which
Fate had condemned her gave little time for lovers’ meetings.
Not for a moment did she think of breaking with
her work and taking a holiday; it had become a part of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
life; to cease working, to give up a day just for her own
pleasure never occurred to her.</p>

<p>“Here,” said she, at last, “an hour before sunset. I will
then have returned from Calabasse.”</p>

<p>“You will surely be here?”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>The word was less a word than a sigh.</p>

<p>Surely be there?—nothing but death would stop her
from being there, mornes, and mountains, endless roads to
be travelled by her little feet, heat of day, or storm, nothing
overcomable by human heart and will could stop her
from being there, and she said it all in that sigh which
was half a word.</p>

<p>He took her hand and held it to his lips for a moment.
It was their first kiss. Then side by side they began to
descend the steep way to the city. It was late for St.
Pierre where people went to bed shortly after sundown,
the moon was just lifting above the mountains and the
sound of the sea came up from the bay, breathing through
the empty streets and mixing with the rippling and tinkling
of the fountains and water courses.</p>

<p>The Street of the Precipice was filled with moonlight.
The old street, to-night, was Romance itself made visible.
The heavy-shuttered houses, the coigns of shadow, the
causeway of moonlight leading the eye downward to the
ghost of a silver sea.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the street she turned and gave him
her hand. She did not wish him to come further, Man’m
Charles would be sitting up to let her in. She had never
been so late before and though she felt no qualms at all at
the cause of her lateness she did not wish her aunt to hear
her saying good-bye to Gaspard, that would mean explanations.
All that day, its blueness, its fragrance, its mystery;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
the sunlight, and the hills, the distant ocean, the
twilight in which her soul had met and touched the soul
that had come to find her from far across the sea, all that
seemed like some mysterious flower coloured with the colours
of earth but immortal as the light of the stars.</p>

<p>Finotte, Florine, Lys, wandering in the fields of youth
had plucked roses, lilies, flowers of a moment. She wandering
alone, had found this flower of light, deathless, and
indestructible. Let the world pass, let the man she loved
betray her, let come what might, her flower would never
fade.</p>

<p>He watched her as she passed away down the Street of
the Precipice, she, whose grace Theocritus might have sung
in the warmth of some Sicilian night, and as he watched
her, just for a moment, there came upon him, untutored
as he was, a breath from long ago. It was as though doors
had been flung open to all the songs, the perfumes, and
the starlight of all the nights of the past, nights by the
Sicilian sea before Taormina had become a desolation, love
songs blown across the roses, roses casting their fragrance
to the sea and stars.</p>

<p>He saw the little figure, now, away down the street
pausing before a house on the right hand side, then it
vanished, leaving the Street of the Precipice deserted. He
turned homewards, walking slowly; it was still early as
Europeans reckon earliness, yet St. Pierre was already
asleep. In a French town at this hour the cafés would be
still blazing, the streets filled, theatres not yet empty; but
St. Pierre, like a child, went to sleep with the dark; hushed
by the murmur of the sea below and the woods above, and
lit by the fireflies and the stars.</p>

<span class="subhead">SIMON SERPENTE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>He was awakened from sleep next morning by a voice outside
his door.</p>

<p>It was the voice of Captain Sagesse. Then a knock came
to the door and instantly on the knock it opened and the
Captain came into the room.</p>

<p>Gaspard had slept late, it was full morning and the light
was strong enough to shew Sagesse’s face and its expression.
Something was evidently the matter. He shut the
door and crossed the room.</p>

<p>“Here’s a pretty thing,” said Sagesse. “I am betrayed,
my affair has been blown on—Have you spoken?”</p>

<p>“Spoken—on what?”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i> What else but the expedition.”</p>

<p>“I, never—not a word—at least—”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I said to one man that I was going on a voyage with
you, but I said nothing of the nature of the voyage.”</p>

<p>“Who was the man you spoke to?”</p>

<p>“An old gentleman of the name of Seguin.”</p>

<p>“Hell!” cried Sagesse, springing up from the chair on
which he had taken his seat. “Seguin. There is only one
Seguin on the island—ah, that’s where the money is coming
from—” He ceased speaking, sat down on the chair again,
crushed his panama hat, which he had taken off, between
the palms of his hands and stared at the floor with a frown
on his forehead and his lips pursed up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
The evening before, Jules, his first mate and henchman,
had brought him wind of a rumour that was circulating
amidst the drinking bars of the harbour side.</p>

<p>A rumour that Missie Sagesse had discovered the whereabouts
of a wreck laden with kegs of gold dollars, that he
was going to hunt for it, but would, most likely, fail as
another expedition was starting, financed by a man much
richer and more powerful than the Captain.</p>

<p>The whole thing had originated with Jules himself who,
in his cups, had talked to a coloured woman of the secret
which Sagesse had hinted to him. The hatred of the harbour
side for Sagesse had supplied the other imaginary
expedition.</p>

<p>In reality, nothing was known of any importance. Yet
Sagesse, with whom suspicion was almost a disease, was
sure that Gaspard had betrayed him. The only thing that
made him feel uncertain on the matter was the fact that
Gaspard was presumably unacquainted with any rich man
capable of working mischief. And now Gaspard had
confessed speaking to Seguin on the matter! Seguin, one
of the richest men in the island and Sagesse’s greatest
enemy.</p>

<p>The whole thing was plain.</p>

<p>Another man would have given rein to his temper, accused
Gaspard to his face of the imaginary betrayal, come
to blows with him.</p>

<p>But that was not the way of Captain Sagesse.</p>

<p>Gaspard was necessary to him as a working partner. If
money were found, a white man, single-handed, might have
an exceedingly difficult time with the black crew of <i>La
Belle Arlésienne</i>. He had not time to find another white
man to take Gaspard’s place, simply because now that the
secret was known, the expedition must start as quickly as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
possible. No, it would be very impolitic to fight with him
now, afterwards—ah, yes, afterwards when the money was
salved and safe on board the ship, when he had discovered
the temper of the crew under treasure-strain, then it would
be different. He promised himself some satisfaction then,
and promising himself this he unbent his brows and ceased
to purse his lips.</p>

<p>“After all,” said he, “what does it matter? You say you
told nothing to Paul Seguin. I believe you. All the same,
he has got wind of the affair, he is going to send a man on
the same job—”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Tenez</i>,” said Gaspard, “same job, how can he, when
nobody knows about the island but you and me?”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Sagesse, “that’s the mystery—how indeed?
But he knows it and that is enough for me. I start in three
days’ time.”</p>

<p>“Three days!”</p>

<p>“Yes, by working overtime, I’ll have the cargo out of the
<i>Belle</i> day after to-morrow night—”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vé</i>, but you will want time to get your tackle—”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon Dieu</i>,” said Sagesse, “Do you think I ever say
I’m going to do a thing without having my plans ready
made? Come with me and you will see. We can have
breakfast somewhere together and talk everything over
when I have done my business.”</p>

<p>Gaspard got up and dressed and then the two men left
the house and walked down the Rue du Morne side by side
towards the harbour. Often in his life, Sagesse had been
approached on the subject of sunken treasure. The Caribbean
and the Atlantic about the Bahamas give a fine field
for theoretical treasure-seekers, locations of sunken ships
had been brought to him off Rum Cay, off Grand Cayman,
off Matanzas. The ships were there right enough only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
waiting to be rifled, but Sagesse would have nothing to do
with them. He had a profound knowledge of the sea and
its trickery. He knew that though the ships were there
they were tormented by currents, currents that varied with
the ebb and flow so that divers could work only at slack;
he knew the power of these currents to heap sand and hide
treasure. He had seen the end of a broken deep-sea cable
brought up, half a mile of it tied in knots by the mischievous
hands of the currents as though some giant had been
playing with it.</p>

<p>“When a treasure ship lies a prey to the currents of the
sea, there is no use in hunting for treasure or for anything
but disappointment,” was an axiom with him.</p>

<p>What led him to the present adventure was the fact that
the ship was lying in a still lagoon in which diving operations
could be conducted as easily as in a lake. She was
not sanded up but coralled over, and if there was “stuff”
in her a few charges of dynamite would soon lay her open.</p>

<p>The morning was bright over the sea when they reached
the harbour side, <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> was lying out on the
blue water, the lighters beside her and the cargo coming
out to the tune of winch pawls and the chanty of the
<span class="locked">negroes—</span></p>

<p>To southward of <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> a big three-master<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
was getting up anchor, a cable ship the <i>Grappler</i> was
tramping the bay taking soundings. The water sinks to a
tremendous depth here between Martinique and Dominica
and from the <i>Grappler</i> away out on the violet blue of the
“deeps” came the faint sewing-machine whirr of the Kelvin
sounder at work.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Canotiers</i> were paddling their tiny cargoes round the
steamer from New York that had arrived the evening before
and would start at noon; one could see the little <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canotiers,</i>
lemon-coloured slips of children standing up and diving for
coins flung by the passengers.</p>

<p>It was a picture full of the spirit of morning, full of
colour, and light, and movement, the hot wind of the tropics
stirring flags and shaking out sail-cloth; sea gulls were
fishing, flickering snow-white in the wind, their querulous
cries came across the bay with the clank of the winch
pawls, capstan pawls, and anchor-chain, and the endless

<p class="in0">Faint, musical with distance.</p>

<p>Sagesse, leading the way, they passed along the shore
edge to the Place Bertine.</p>

<p>The sunlight was just striking the Place Bertine over
the shoulder of Pelée. In the blaze of morning light with
the sea and wind shaking the tamarind trees, it formed a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
bright picture; women’s coloured dresses, turbans of yellow
madras, men, some clad in white, some half naked,
rolling the sugar hogsheads, laughing, and singing as they
worked, all coloured men, from the white Creole to the jet-black
negro; children—and you may be sure that wherever
there is sugar either in cane or barrel you will find children—playing
games, running messages; children black as
sloes, yellow as bananas, honey-coloured babies naked as
on the day they were born; over all the warm tropic wind
blowing lazily, mixing the scent of the sea with the perfume
of the land, cigar scent—for even the women are
smoking the black Martinique <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bouts</i>,—and the subtle ubiquitous
scent of sugar in bulk.</p>

<p>Sagesse led the way across the Place to the row of warehouses
and go-downs bordering it on the shore edge. He
paused at an archway giving entrance to a big twilit warehouse,
peeped into the gloom of the place as if in search
of someone or something, and then entered followed by
Gaspard.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary warehouse, this, smelling of tar,
sail-cloth, and rope. Piles of rusty chain, cable, old
anchors, capstan bars, spars of all sorts, blocks of all sizes
lay about, and in the gloom, ropes and remnants of tackle
hanging from the beams overhead gave a last touch to the
picture. One might have fancied it a cave in which a ship
had come to wreck, or several ships for the matter of that.</p>

<p>In the midst of all the rubbish and odds and ends, the
owner of the place, Monsieur Jaques, known as Jaques <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tout
court</i> by shipmasters from Port of Spain to Port Royal,
moved about superintending three men who were engaged
with palm and needle patching a sail spread on a vacant
space of the floor.</p>

<p>There are some men who, vulture-like, make their living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
out of the ruin and dead bones of things, only in that way
do they prosper, Jaques was one of these men, though you
would never have guessed his vulturous instincts from his
appearance which was that of a plump prosperous-looking
business man, rather past the prime of life, grey-headed,
clean-shaven, always smiling, always calm, always polite,
always seeming to yield to your wishes—but iron in driving
a bargain.</p>

<p>His business in life was the buying up of old ships and
odds and ends of ships for next to nothing, and selling the
remains at a profit. If you wanted an anchor or a suit of
sails or a spar, he could always supply you. He would
buy wrecks even when they were sunken—that is to say, of
course, if they were lying in shallow water. He had bought
in this way the <i>Amine-Martell</i>, lying on the thunderous
beach to westward of Grande Anse. The bay in which she
was lying was a death trap inaccessible from the sea or
from the land, the cliffs were sheer walls of black rock
polished and flawless; by lowering men over the cliff edge
by ropes he had salved thirty-five thousand dollars in gold
coin—a profitable business considering the fact that he had
paid only two thousand dollars for her as she lay.</p>

<p>From Curaçoa to Porto Rico he had conducted salvage
operations, fighting the sea for the pickings of ships, conducting
the operations in person when there seemed a
chance of good profits on the job.</p>

<p>Sagesse took Monsieur Jaques aside and explained what
he wanted whilst Gaspard sat on a spar-end and watched
the sail-patchers at work.</p>

<p>“I’ve got some diving work on hand,” said Sagesse. “I
want two divers’ suits, a pump, everything complete. Have
you them, and how much will you charge to hire them for
two months?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
“Two thousand dollars deposit and five hundred for the
hire,” replied Jaques without a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“Three hundred and not a cent more.”</p>

<p>“My price is five hundred—and if you don’t like it I
am sorry. I have already been approached by a gentleman
on the same subject. I am expecting him here any moment,
if he concludes the bargain with me, where else will you
get diving apparatus—not in Martinique.”</p>

<p>This of course was a lie, but the mind of Sagesse, fogged
with suspicion, saw in it a confirmation of the rumour that
another expedition was on foot. Jaques, watchful as a bird
of prey, saw the effect of his words without understanding
entirely the reason.</p>

<p>“Who is this other person, then,” said Sagesse. “You
can at least tell me his name.”</p>

<p>“I never give names in business, Captain, but as you have
been my customer up to this, I will whisper something in
your ear.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jaques, lowering his voice, “I expect he is a
gentleman on the same business as yourself.”</p>

<p>“The Devil!” said Sagesse. Then, recollecting himself,
he laughed.</p>

<p>“If he is, he’s on a business that won’t bring him much
profit—well, I can’t waste any more time, let’s see the suits
and the apparatus.”</p>

<p>Jaques led the way through a door to the back premises,
where in a shed were the diving suits, the pump, the air
tubes, all nearly new and in good working order. The pump
was constructed so that it could be fixed in a boat or be
used from on board ship. <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> had a boat
that would do for the work to a nicety, she would have to be
hauled across the islet and floated in the lagoon. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
busy mind of the captain was arranging all these details as
he examined the gear. Then, turning to Jaques:</p>

<p>“Three hundred for the hire and not a cent more.”</p>

<p>“Five hundred and not a cent less. Why should I let
you have a thing for three hundred which I can hire out
to someone else for five—that is not business.”</p>

<p>“Four hundred, come, the money down and the deposit.”</p>

<p>“Five hundred and not a cent less.”</p>

<p>“Four-fifty.”</p>

<p>“Why should I defraud myself of fifty dollars.”</p>

<p>“Well, five hundred be it.”</p>

<p>“And of course, M. le Capitaine, you will be responsible
for any injury to the apparatus.”</p>

<p>“There will be no injury—and now that we have concluded
business, I’ll tell you the name of the man who
wanted to cut me out—who wanted to hire these things.”</p>

<p>Jaques, pleased with the bargain he had struck, delighted
with the success of his ruse, and more delighted with the
fact that it was the wily Captain Sagesse who had fallen
a victim to his bluff, said nothing, but smiled.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you?”</p>

<p>“If it pleases you.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was Paul Seguin—am I not right?”</p>

<p>“I cannot say—I never tell secrets of business.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Sagesse. “I want this matter put
right. You and I have known each other for years. I want
the information because I believe I have been betrayed on
some business I have in hand. See here, if you whisper the
name of the man who came to you about those diving suits,
I’ll never tell, but I’ll be sure in my mind and on my guard,
and I’ll pay you five dollars for the information.”</p>

<p>He took the money from his pocket as he spoke. “You’ll
not tell—it will be kept entirely between ourselves?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
“Yes, I promise.”</p>

<p>“Then give me your ear.” Jaques approached his head
close to the other’s and in a low voice said:</p>

<p>“Paul Seguin.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Sagesse, handing over the money which
Monsieur Jaques pocketed. Five dollars for just a lie was
the best bargain he had ever made.</p>

<p>As Sagesse came through the warehouse, he found Gaspard
still seated on the spar end watching the sail-patchers
at their work. He could have shot him with all the pleasure
in life, yet he greeted him cheerily and with a smile.</p>

<p>It is a profound popular mistake to attribute no sense of
honour to a scoundrel.</p>

<p>He has the keenest sense of honour—in others. He
feels when he is betrayed just as an honourable man feels
only, perhaps, more acutely.</p>

<p>“And now that we have finished business,” said Jaques,
“will you not take some refreshment, you and your friend?”
He opened a door leading from the warehouse to a room,
half sitting-room, half office, ushered them in, and opening
another door, called for coffee, rum, and cigarettes.</p>

<p>In a moment, a servant, bearing a huge tray spread with
the ordinary Martinique <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">petit déjeuner</i>, entered. Gaspard
scarcely heard the entrance of the servant, he was examining
a picture hanging on the pine boarding of the wall, a
small, old-fashioned wood-engraving that had struck his
eye immediately he entered and now held him fascinated as
the serpent on the Place du Fort had held old M. Seguin.</p>

<p>It represented a man small and hideous, holding in one
hand an immense sword and in the other hand a whip.</p>

<p>He was dressed in a shirt and loose trousers, a broad
sash was round his waist and from the sash peeped the
butt of a pistol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
The thing was horrible and grotesque. The man’s head
and face were scarcely larger than the head and face of a
child; yet the face had in it the ferocity of a demon; it
was of extraordinary breadth across the cheek bones.</p>

<p>The limbs, as far as the clothing allowed them to be
seen, were deformed, and as Gaspard stood fascinated and
repelled, a shiver ran through him. He had seen this man—this
thing—before—where? Impossible to say; in some
past life, in some dream—glimpsed, perhaps, in the midst
of some crowd, through the fumes of tobacco in some bar—somewhere,
at some time in his life, he had seen that hideous
head.</p>

<p>More, he felt that the creature, half man, half demon,
had entered his life once, bringing evil into it. Yet, wildly
searching his memory, he could remember nothing of the
circumstance.</p>

<p>“Coffee or cognac?”</p>

<p>Monsieur Jaques was speaking and Gaspard turned from
the picture and accepting a cup of coffee and a cigarette,
took his seat at the table with the others.</p>

<p>Jaques, a cigar in his mouth and a cup of coffee before
him, was deep in trade talk with Sagesse and Gaspard,
pretending interest in their conversation, but hearing
nothing, gazed round the room, taking in its details.</p>

<p>The walls were decorated with drawings of ships, Carib
paddles, gourds, a glass case containing beetles and tarantulas,
things of sea and land, but mostly of the sea.</p>

<p>Here was a chart of the Yucatan Straits marked in ink
with the soundings of a wreck; beside it a chart of the
waters just westward of Nassau where lies a great pond
of the sea nearly two hundred miles from north to south
surrounded with shoal water and reefs, this chart was
marked, too, with the position of a wreck. A battle-lantern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
that might have lit Van Horne on some night expedition,
hung from a staple near the charts, Jaques had picked
it up in the sands near San Juan; an old curaçoa flask with
a leathern handle, the earliest form of the bottle in which
the Dutch exported their liqueur, hung by the lantern. The
history of the Caribbean and the Spanish Main lay here
in these things and many more, but let his eyes rove as
they might, Gaspard could not stop them from returning
to the picture that had fascinated him.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of a pause in the conversation between
Jaques and Sagesse, Gaspard leaned forward:</p>

<p>“Excuse me, monsieur,” said he, pointing to the picture,
“but you have a strange portrait on your wall, and the
strangest thing about it is that I feel I have seen the
gentleman before.”</p>

<p>Jaques looked at the picture and laughed. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ma foi</i>,”
said he, “if you have seen him alive you are older than I
am. You have most likely seen him in a print, but not
such a good print as that one, it is by Coullier, very old,
and I picked it up for a song.”</p>

<p>“And the name of the man?”</p>

<p>“It is Simon Serpente.”</p>

<p>“Who was he?”</p>

<p>“What! you have never heard of Simon Serpente—ah,
but I forgot, you are, no doubt, fresh to the West Indies.
Well, monsieur, Simon Serpente was a devil—He was a
man all the same—”</p>

<p>Here Sagesse nodded as though he knew all about Simon
Serpente.</p>

<p>“But,” continued Jaques, “he was all the same a devil.
We have had a good many devils in these parts in the old
days, but Simon out-Heroded them all. He was one of
the last of the pirates and the worst. Kidd, Horne, Singleton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
were not so bad as him. What do you say, Monsieur
le Capitaine?”</p>

<p>“O, from all accounts he was a tough man,” said Sagesse.
“I’ve never held with these cut-throat scoundrels, if they’d
lived in my day I’d have rooted them out if I’d been in
power. The government could have done it then, only they
were bribed. Don’t tell me, the governors in those days
grew fat on pirates.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said Jaques, “and Serpente kept his head
out of the noose more than once by gilding it, all the same,
Serpente was feared for himself, they said he was not a
man, they said that no one could kill him and that when
he departed this life he would have to die by his own hand,
people imagined that he brought bad luck to anyone who
crossed his path or at whom he looked crookedly.”</p>

<p>“All that is women’s talk,” said Sagesse, “there is no
such thing as bad luck—or devil for the matter of that—go
on.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jaques, “if there is no such thing as bad
luck, at all events, Serpente did not bring good luck and he
got such a name for being the Devil himself that he made
men frightened of him, even the fellows of his own stamp.</p>

<p>“He’d been pirating for years and he’d made a very
large fortune, no one knew where he had hidden it, wind
got about that he had an island of his own somewhere in
the Caribbean but no one ever tried to find it, for, I tell
you quite plainly, that had his treasure been lying on the
beach down there, people would have let it lie—”</p>

<p>“Fools,” said Sagesse.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, but, all the same, I doubt if I would have
cared to meddle with it myself. People said it was the
Devil’s treasure and that it was well-guarded—I am not so
sure that they were fools either. I know Monsieur le Capitaine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
you are sceptical on these points, but I have seen bad
effects following upon money got by force and blood and
inherited. Anyhow, the money of Simon Serpente I would
not have touched. Dieu! the things that man was credited
with I would not speak of, even before you, and so he
went through life till all at once he gave up pirating. It
was a most extraordinary ending to his piracy too, for he
fell foul of Laropé off Matanzas. Laropé, you must know,
was a brother pirate, his ship was the <i>Golden-Shell</i>, Serpente’s
ship was the <i>Puerto Mexico</i>, both ships had been
chasing a brigantine when Serpente signalled Laropé to
haul off, that the prize was his, as he had sighted it first;
Laropé refused, and the next thing he knew, was that his
maintop mast had been shot away.</p>

<p>“Then, forgetting the brigantine, the two pirates closed.
It was off Matanzas and the shore was crowded with people
watching, they said that the guns could be heard at
Havana, the wind being from the east. The upshot was
that Serpente laid the <i>Puerto Mexico</i> alongside the <i>Golden-Shell</i>,
boarded her, put every man to death <em>and hanged
Laropé from his own main yard for a pirate</em>.</p>

<p>“Then Serpente, leaving the <i>Golden-Shell</i> to float derelict,
sailed away in the direction of Cape Sable. He never
hoisted the black flag again and the next thing we hear
about him is that he turned his ship into a slaver. Turned
respectable, so to speak.</p>

<p>“Men no longer feared him so much now. They said that
if he was really a devil he would not have turned over a
new leaf. They began to remember his crimes and a movement
was set on foot against him.</p>

<p>“He heard this, but he did not seem to mind, putting it
down most likely, to idle talk, till one day definite news
came to him as he was leaving the American coast with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
cargo of slaves that a corvette was out against him and that
when he was caught he would be hanged.</p>

<p>“Surely enough, two days out from port, he sighted a corvette
and she chased him. The <i>Puerto Mexico</i> could give
heels to anything in those waters, and by sundown the corvette
was only showing her topsails above the horizon and
by next dawn she was gone; but Serpente knew that all
was over with him in these seas. The Devil had branded
him with such a face and form that he could not hope to
hide himself, so he perhaps made sail for that island of his
where he had placed his treasure—at all events he was
never seen again.”</p>

<p>“Ah, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i>” suddenly cried Gaspard. He rose to
his feet and went over to the picture on the wall.</p>

<p>Of a sudden it had flashed upon him where he had seen
the frame-work of that face, that contorted form—the hideous
skull on the island, the bones, could they have been
the remains of Simon Serpente?</p>

<p>The thing seemed madly improbable, till across his mind
flashed the vision of the pouch and belt, with the initials
S.&nbsp;S. on the buckle.</p>

<p>Then he felt, on a sudden, physically ill.</p>

<p>The hideous demon of the picture had, then, entered into
his life, he could not doubt that the skeleton was that
of Serpente and that the money in the belt was that of
Serpente.</p>

<p>And he had warred with Yves over that money and he
had killed Yves. For a moment he saw Evil in all its horror
and the tenacious clutch which Evil has upon life. To
look at this hideous monkey-man was bad enough, but to
feel that you were his inheritor, and that, quarrelling over
this inheritance, you had killed your friend, was beyond
words shocking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
It is so seldom that God gives us an objective view of
evil, that the sight when it comes is prodigious and soul-shaking.</p>

<p>Gaspard looked at the picture of the man whose money
had soiled his hands. This man, dead long years ago,
Anisette, living, but thousands of miles away, these two
were of the same brand, belonged to the company of evil,
they could touch nothing without tainting it and betraying
it to evil, just as they had tainted Gaspard and betrayed
him into the hands of Sagesse.</p>

<p>Controlling his emotion, he turned again to the table
from which Sagesse was now rising to go.</p>

<p>Monsieur Jaques accompanied them through the storehouse,
bade them good-bye, and next moment they were in
the brilliant sunshine of the Place Bertine, Sagesse leading
the way to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>“I am going on board to see how things are getting on,”
said he, “you had better come with me and help. We can
have something to eat aboard and you will want to overhaul
your cabin—Hi there, bring your boat along here!”</p>

<p>He called to a longshoreman—a negro, black, and fantastic
as a golliwog—who was paddling his boat along the
shore edge, the man brought the boat up as directed and
they stepped in.</p>

<p>The morning had become utterly windless, and the sea
like a mirror. Away out towards Dominica, a becalmed,
inter-island schooner lay helpless, the snow-white sails casting
a mile-long reflection on the water, the three-master
which had been getting her anchor up had scarcely filled
her sails when the calm fell, striking the life out of her. St.
Pierre, coloured houses and motionless palms, stood fronting
the blue, and passionately burning sea. It was the
scenery of a most vivid dream, such infinities of colour and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
light and silence cast on the mind the unreality of mirage.
The very sounds from the city and the shipping in the bay
were dream sounds, voices of visionary sailors, murmurs
from lotus-land.</p>

<p>Even the old <i>Belle Arlésienne</i>, that hag of the ocean, was
touched by the magic of the day. Masts and spars and
rigging, sun-blistered sides, all were reflected in the mirror
of the harbour whilst her copper shewed up through
the emerald-tinted shadows of the water; and the southern
weeds and strips of fuci growing from the copper waved
as if blown by a faint wind.</p>

<p>The cargo was coming out as fast as winches worked by
hand could lift it, Jules was overseeing the work and he
cast down the ladder for them to come on board. Sagesse
when he reached the deck, looked around to see how things
were going, then he entered the deck-house followed by
Gaspard.</p>

<p>“You’ll take the same cabin,” said Sagesse, pointing to
the dog hole on the starboard side, “I’ll tell Jules to get
one of the niggers to clear it out for you, there’s a lot of
old truck there that wants shifting and it will give you
more room, you won’t have much gear to bring on board, I
expect.”</p>

<p>“Not much—you say you are starting in three days, to-day
is Tuesday—”</p>

<p>“I start on Friday.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, on Friday—well, it seems to me that is not a
very good day to start on.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cordieu!</i>” cried Sagesse, suddenly shewing irritation,
“what sort of old woman’s talk is that. What is wrong
with Friday?”</p>

<p>Gaspard leaned against a bulkhead with his arms folded,
he had scarcely spoken a word since leaving Jaques’ store
and Sagesse had noticed his silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
“I do not know what is wrong with Friday, but I do
know that with a whole week to choose from, I would choose
some other day, especially starting on an expedition of this
sort. However, you can choose what day you like. I have
only one question to ask you.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Will you release me from the business and get someone
else to take my place?”</p>

<p>Sagesse rapped out a laugh, took his seat at the table,
folded his arms and, leaning over his folded arms, stared at
his companion.</p>

<p>He did not speak for a moment. He seemed trying to
read Gaspard’s innermost thoughts. Then “No,” he cried,
“a hundred times no, you are part of the business, you
gave your word, and now you want to back out—I find this
morning my plans betrayed to this cursed Seguin. I say
nothing about that; but this I say, you come with me or I
will take you along with a member of La Garde Royale, we
will hunt for the remains of a gentleman who was killed—we
will look for his clothing and his bones. We will—”
Sagesse stopped as Gaspard, leaving the bulkhead, took a
seat at the table right opposite to him.</p>

<p>“You will do a lot,” said Gaspard, “if I take you by the
throat and drag you out on deck and fling you into the
harbour like the carrion you are. I have given you my
word to go with you, on your cursed expedition, and go I
will. Let no more be said. You talk of hunting for bones,
you will find them. Skeleton Island ought to be the name
of that place and if you don’t leave your own skeleton there
you will be lucky.”</p>

<p>“Threats!” cried Sagesse, making as if to rise from the
table.</p>

<p>“Threats—I never threaten and I am not threatening
you now. I say you will be lucky if you don’t leave your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
bones behind you for the place is cursed—see you here—”</p>

<p>He leaned across the table facing Sagesse, and, lowering
his voice—“See you here, I told you how I fought with
a man out there and how, by accident, I killed him; well, I
did not tell you all—after he was dead things happened.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Even before he was dead I did not like the place, that
ship down in the water seemed to me the devil’s own ship,
no one ever saw a ship like that before, she was like an old
drowning corpse and then all of a sudden just at sundown,
she came to life, lit up as though she were hung with
lamps—”</p>

<p>“Phosphorus,” said Sagesse.</p>

<p>“It was not, it was just the light in the sky, God’s good
sunlight, but I have never seen such a thing before. Well,
what happened next day? I killed my friend, I flung my
knife at him, but I did not mean to kill, no, but the devil
who lives on that island, took care that the knife did its
work. Next day, as I was standing on the reef, looking out
for ships, I felt someone standing behind me. There was
no one to be seen but there was someone there, the very
gulls in that place are not right, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bon Dieu</i>, they shout at
one—then, in the night someone beat a drum close to my
tent—I nearly left my reason behind in that place—well,
now, listen, I escaped, I said to myself, ‘never will I go
back there,’ look at my luck. I meet you. I take too much
rum, I talk to you and shew you that cursed gold, and
what’s the result? Well, I’m going back, against my
will—”</p>

<p>“To make your fortune against your will,” said Sagesse
with a sneer, “and you call that bad luck.”</p>

<p>“Fortune,” cried Gaspard, echoing the sneering tone of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
the other, “and you expect to take a fortune from that
place?”</p>

<p>“If it is there, I will take it.”</p>

<p>“I tell you if it were lying on the beach, you will not
take it.”</p>

<p>“And who will prevent me?”</p>

<p>“There is one there who will prevent you.”</p>

<p>“And who is he?”</p>

<p>“Simon Serpente.”</p>

<p>Sagesse looked at his companion as if doubting his reason.</p>

<p>“Simon Serpente.”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the last few hours I have discovered whose
ship that is lying there in the water, and whose money that
was we found in the belt. I told you there was a skeleton
by the money; well, see here, the skull wasn’t bigger than
that.” He held his hands together as if clasping lightly
the head of a child, “and it was not a right skull, why, I
said to Yves, ‘Well, he must have been a beauty, the fellow
this belonged to,’ then the bones were not the bones of an
ordinary man, the minute I set eyes on that picture of Serpente,
I said to myself, ‘I have seen that thing before, but
where?’ It wasn’t till Monsieur Jaques told me his story,
that I recognised the truth of the thing and that the skeleton
was the skeleton of Serpente.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish,” replied Sagesse, “you are full up of fo’csle
fancies; Serpente—I don’t believe myself a quarter I have
heard about the chap—you talk like some old Creole woman.
If Serpente ever lived, he died in some grog shop, like the
rest of his sort, filled with balloon juice; or got knocked on
the head in some fight down a back alley—”</p>

<p>“One moment—I shewed you the belt and the pouch
which I brought from the island; on the buckle of the belt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
two letters were scratched, you examined them yourself—what
were they?”</p>

<p>Sagesse started in his chair. He had cast his memory
back.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Cordieu!</i>” cried he, “I remember now.”</p>

<p>“What were the letters?”</p>

<p>“By my faith, it’s strange, S.&nbsp;S. It would be the fellow’s
initials.”</p>

<p>“Just so.”</p>

<p>“Simon Serpente.”</p>

<p>“Just so.”</p>

<p>“You did not scratch those letters yourself?”</p>

<p>Gaspard laughed.</p>

<p>“Did I know at that time anything about Serpente?”</p>

<p>“That is true.”</p>

<p>Sagesse’s face had flushed, he sat with his fingers drumming
on the table and his eyes fixed on his fingers.</p>

<p>He seemed plunged in reverie of an exciting nature, then,
suddenly recovering himself, he brought his great fist
down with a bang on the table.</p>

<p>“That’s luck—one can’t doubt—He went to his hive—He’d
have been making for Europe, something happened to
his ship and sunk it, who knows what, but one may swear
that he left his bones close to his money.”</p>

<p>Then to Gaspard: “Can’t you see?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The gold, it’s there as sure as I am here.”</p>

<p>“I am certain of that.”</p>

<p>“Then what are you grumbling about, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mordieu</i>, you look
as though you had lost a fortune instead of having found
one.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be better to lose a fortune than find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
one like that. Have it as you will, though, but at least
remember my words if anything should happen.”</p>

<p>“And what may they be, those words of yours?” asked
Sagesse rising, going to the locker, and pouring himself
out a dram.</p>

<p>“Just this, there’s a curse on that place as sure as my
name is Gaspard Cadillac, and the man who goes hunting
there for treasure will find more than he expects.”</p>

<p>Sagesse drank off his dram.</p>

<span class="subhead">SKELETON ISLAND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Then Gaspard came on deck. He had spoken his mind
and he felt easier. He had tried to dissuade Sagesse from
disturbing this resting-place of bones and possible treasure,
Sagesse would not be dissuaded, all the same Gaspard felt
easier. He had, in plain English, a holy terror of Simon
Serpente. His sufferings on the island, his ill-luck in
killing Yves and betraying himself to Sagesse, the horrible
personality of Serpente and the fact that he had seen and
handled his bones just before the tragedy of Yves, all these
things combined with superstition to make this monster-man,
dead long years ago, a living, and vital personality to
Gaspard. He feared him a great deal more than he feared
the devil. He was not sure at all that the devil had existence
or power over man, but he was sure that Serpente had
acted as an excellent substitute for the devil in life and
that in death he was still harmful.</p>

<p>For Gaspard the <em>Ka</em> of Simon Serpente existed on that
island, guarding the bones it had once surrounded and the
treasure it had once amassed; in trying to dissuade Sagesse
from the expedition, he felt he had propitiated this <em>Ka</em>, the
wrath of the thing he fancied would fall on Sagesse, and
as he leaned on the bulwark rail thinking over the situation
and the forthcoming expedition, an unholy curiosity
awoke in his mind as to the upshot of the affair.</p>

<p>I doubt if he would have drawn back from it now, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
if he could; curiosity, whose hold upon the superstitious
mind is profound, had him in her grip.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Curiosity, “I will show you something
strange.”</p>

<p>As he gazed across the blue water of the harbour at the
coloured town, the palms, the high woods, leaping green
against the blue sky, he remembered Marie. Simon Serpente
had driven her for a moment from his mind. He
was to meet her this evening, two hours before sunset,
on the road to Morne Rouge.</p>

<p>Contrasted with his gloomy thoughts, how bright seemed
that faithful figure, contrasted with the demon picture of
Serpente, how lovely was this form! From where he
stood he could see, or thought he could see, the beginning
of the road to Morne Rouge, up there where the houses
fell away and the palms took the place of buildings.</p>

<p>His heart leaped to the spot.</p>

<p>As he was leaning on the rail and looking, Sagesse came
out of the deck-house. The negroes at work on the cargo
had knocked off for a spell, boats had come alongside
with the wives of the stevedores, bringing their food; each
woman had with her a basket covered with a white cloth
and each basket was divided into compartments containing
fruit, fish—generally <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sádines</i>—and bread.</p>

<p>As the men chattered with their wives, Sagesse and Gaspard
went round the decks; the cargo was half out; it
was a very light cargo and it was easy to see that <i>La Belle
Arlésienne</i> would be clear of it and in ballast by Friday
morning. Having satisfied himself on this point, Gaspard
went to the little cabin that had been allotted to him
and began turning out the rubbish with which it was encumbered,
old bottles and cigar boxes, bundles of old newspapers,
all sorts of useless raffle; when the place was clear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeuner</i> was ready, corossoles, chicken and rice, fruit, and
the inevitable rum. The negro cook placed the things on
the table and retired.</p>

<p>Sagesse was cheerful during the meal, even friendly;
never would you have thought that this man had only a
short time ago held out threats against his table companion.
I doubt, even, if his cheerfulness was assumed
or his friendliness false; he had the art, almost a horrible
art, of packing away in his mind ill feeling, distrust, suspicion,
against a man, keeping them cool and fresh till
they were wanted. He was almost certain that Gaspard
had betrayed the secret of the island to Seguin, but he
shewed nothing of it in his manner, felt, perhaps, nothing
of it in his mind, as he enjoyed the excellent food before
him and talked of trade, of the cargo, of the customs—and
the hundred and one things that are bound up with
trade, the tropics, and the sea.</p>

<p>After <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeuner</i>, Gaspard lit a pipe and lay down in
his cabin for a siesta; he kept the door open for coolness
and he could see out beyond the cave-like twilight of the
deck-house a glimpse of the sun-smitten deck; then he fell
asleep, and when he awoke it was three o’clock.</p>

<p>He turned out of the bunk and came on deck. The
winches were still going; Sagesse was nowhere to be seen;
Jules, who was superintending the unloading of the cargo,
said that Missie Sagesse had gone ashore an hour ago.</p>

<p>He was very friendly, Jules, and anxious to please, and
leaving the hands to look after themselves for a moment,
he called a shore boat that was hanging about the ship
and with his own hands dropped the rope ladder for
Gaspard.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the boat had landed Gaspard at the
harbour steps; he paid the man, and taking his way up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Passage Bartine, made for the Rue Victor Hugo. He did
not know that one of the boatmen was following him.</p>

<p>As he entered the Rue Victor Hugo he met M. Seguin,
who had just returned from Grand Anse; it was one of
those accidental meetings that Fate arranges. M. Seguin
shook hands with his preserver, then, taking him by the
arm, led him across the way to the Café Palmiste.</p>

<p>An hour later, the news was brought to Sagesse that
Gaspard had met M. Seguin, evidently by appointment,
in the Rue Victor Hugo, and that both men had entered
a café.</p>

<p>This confirmation of his suspicions was the only thing
wanted to fix in Sagesse’s mind the certainty that he was
betrayed.</p>

<p>He had no fear of Seguin stealing a march on him, for
<i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> would be away long before Seguin
could commission a ship.</p>

<p>But he swore a frightful oath to be even with Gaspard
when the moment arrived—and the place.</p>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<span class="subhead">THE GARDEN OF LOVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“And now,” said Gaspard, “I must be going.”</p>

<p>He had been for half an hour in the Café Palmiste opposite
M. Seguin, a cup of coffee, and a box of cigars.</p>

<p>He rose from the table and his companion rose also,
accompanying him to the door.</p>

<p>“Well, if you have business, I will not detain you—so
you start on Friday? I may see you before you go, anyhow,
remember Paul Seguin, who is always your friend,
and be careful with that shark of a Sagesse—you say you
will be back in a few months’ time, well, when you come
back, come right over to Grand Anse and we will arrange
a future for you, you must not leave the island, you will
marry and settle here; I will find you a home and work, not
at St. Pierre, but over at Grande Anse where it is cool and
where the trade wind is always blowing.”</p>

<p>They shook hands and M. Seguin returned to his coffee
and his eternal cigars, whilst Gaspard struck up town,
taking the Rue Carcenet which was the nearest way to his
destination.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he was at the commencement of the
road to Morne Rouge, at the exact spot where on the evening
before, he had stood with Marie looking down at the
lights of St. Pierre.</p>

<p>He was before his time; the sun would not reach the
horizon for two hours and a half, and leaning on the old,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
moss-grown, lizard-haunted wall that protected the road to
seaward, he looked down at the city, the harbour and the bay.</p>

<p>It was that beneficial moment of the tropic day when,
“getting towards evening” the world, released from the ferocious
kisses of the vertical sun, breathes again.</p>

<p>The light was still tremendous and triumphant, but the
shadows were lengthening, and the old road broken, now, by
wall and palm shadows, shadows of tamarind and ceiba,
filled with scents of tropical wood life and perfumes from
the sea, had regained the poetry robbed from it by the glare
of noon.</p>

<p>Ah, that old road to Morne Rouge, trodden by the feet
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porteuse</i> and the labourer, the gardeners bringing
their fruit to the market of St. Pierre, and the cane cutters
with their heavy cane knives making for the fields, how
beautiful it seems, viewed across the past. He who has
seen from it the city below and the blue enchanted bay,
will never see a vision more beautiful—and no man will
ever see it more.</p>

<p>And its true beauty, one would imagine, only revealed
to a child like Marie, fresh-sighted to the beauty of the
world, or a man like Gaspard, made clear-sighted by love.</p>

<p>He flung the cigarette he was smoking away, and, leaning
on the wall, looked down at the view, lazily tracing the
streets below.</p>

<p>He could see the pale green stripe that indicated the
verandahs of the Rue Victor Hugo; the little Place de la
Fontaine; the Rue Petit Versailles, and, away below, the
tamarinds on the Place Bertine. There lay <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>,
a toy ship, and to southward of <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>,
fussing along across the bay, the little steamer from
Fort de France; the indescribable splendour of the blue
beyond lay unruffled by the slightest breeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Never was there a more profound calm; towards Dominica
where the deep violet of the water proclaimed the great
depths, an inter-island schooner lay becalmed like a thing
that had made part of the picture forever. And the silence
of it all, the coloured city, the painted bay, the illimitable
distance! With the help of that majestic silence completing
her work, Beauty could do nothing more.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ché!</i>”</p>

<p>The word half whispered, spoken behind him, broke
his reverie and made him turn.</p>

<p>She had come along the road moving soundless as a
breeze, she had reached him without his knowing, she
scarcely bore a stain or sign of her long journey; straight
as a caryatid beneath her burden, it was as if she had carried
with her through the long day all the freshness of the
dawn.</p>

<p>All day over morne and mountain, from Morne Rouge
to Calabasse, through the heat and blinding light, she had
followed his image, and she told him so, not with her lips,
but with her eyes, cast straight at him under their long,
black, upcurving lashes.</p>

<p>The first breath of the evening breeze stirred the fronds
of the palms above her, fluted gently her robe of delicately-coloured
striped foulard. The western sunlight enveloped
her in its flame as she stood like the incarnation of the
tropics, the spirit of the western islands, a strophe from
the poem of the palm tree, and the azure.</p>

<p>Gaspard took her hands in his and drew her towards him,
she shuddered slightly. He would have kissed her but
they were not alone, a woman had just turned the bend
of the road, and from below, the bells of a mule told of
some market gardener coming up by the steep path from the
Rue Vauclin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
“You have come.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes—did you not think I would come?”</p>

<p>“O, if I had not thought so I would have flung myself
into the sea.” (Provençal!)</p>

<p>“You would have cared, then?”</p>

<p>“Sweet—my only care is now for you.”</p>

<p>Straight as a flame beneath her load, she listened to him,
and as she listened, her gaze seemed to pass beyond him to
some happy vision in infinity. She seemed like a child
listening for the first time to the voice of Spring. The
man holding her hands was quite taken away from the
world, it was as though she had led him to some extraordinary
height beyond the clouds and was holding him there by
the hands lest he should fall.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, for you, that is all I care—just for you—”</p>

<p>He held her hands to his heart.</p>

<p>A bell bird from the trees beyond the road sent her
golden notes floating on the wind, a shadow passed them,
it was a woman, a mulatress, old, wrinkled, the picture of
age.</p>

<p>Then the mule bells jangled as the mule driven by a
negro scrambled from the steep path on to the road and
Marie, suddenly, like a person awakening from a dream
drew her hands away. Gaspard turned, more people were
coming up the steep way from the Rue Vauclin.</p>

<p>“Come,” said he, “let us go away from all these people,
where is there, here, that we may be quiet, and where you
can rest after your journey?”</p>

<p>“Come with me,” she said.</p>

<p>She led the way down towards the town, they passed
along one of the higher streets and at the door of a heavily-built
house, whose green window shutters were drawn
against the afternoon sun, she knocked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
A woman opened the door, she was a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">calendeuse</i>, a friend
of Marie’s, and the girl asked her to take her tray to keep
till the next morning.</p>

<p>Then, released from her load, she kissed the woman on
the cheek, thanked her, and turned to Gaspard.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said, and the woman closed the door as they
passed away down the road. They passed along by the
highest streets and then down a steep way by an old convent
wall above which the palms of the convent garden
bent to the evening wind. Then, by a path between two
great cactus hedges she led him and lo! they were upon the
road leading over the Morne de Parnasse and close to the
gates of the Jardin des Plantes.</p>

<p>The old garden had drawn her to it at last. Often and
often she had passed the gates, glancing in at the trees and
the gloom, bright and heedless as a butterfly. One might
imagine the spirit of the place watching the girl as she
passed, singing, light-hearted, walking alone and content,
the spirit which is neither malignant nor benign, the spirit
which sets the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">siffleur de montagne</i> singing to his mate, calls
flowers into being, sets blossom calling to blossom and bird
to bird, one might imagine him casting his spell upon the
bright figure, as she passed his gates the other day, and,
now, one might have fancied this spirit of nature sighing
contentedly in the wind-bent trees—she had obeyed the
spell and found a mate.</p>

<p>They passed the gateway and entered a world of twilight
and perfume. Palm stems soared away into the
gloom above; air shoots of the wild pine, ropes of convolvulus,
lianas, festooned and trellised the twilight; gigantic
ferns called the eye into glades where orchids hung like
birds come to ruin, butterflies caught in some trap of the air.</p>

<p>There was not a sound except the sound of the evening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
wind bending the palms and ceibas gently like the caress
of a vast hand.</p>

<p>Here they found themselves alone at last.</p>

<p>He took her hands in his; then, releasing them, he held
her round the waist whilst their lips met and clung together
in an endless kiss.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FATEFUL LIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When Martinique was a young colony, when Versailles
was the palace of a king, away in those sunlit times before
the storm of the Revolution, the Jardin des Plantes of St.
Pierre was a garden. The most curious and the most
beautiful in the world. The spacious imagination that
conceived Versailles touched the tropical forest, and the
hand that laid out Luciennes fell upon the ceibas, the
palmistes and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">loseille bois</i>. The poetry and perfect
beauty of the tropical trees, the splendour of the creeping
plants, fathoms of convolvulus, air gardens where orchids
swung suspended by the cables of the Liantasse, tree ferns,
trumpet flowers, star flowers, all lay there waiting for the
gardener, just as in life all the splendour of passion, the
beauty of love, and the mystery of death lie waiting for
the poet.</p>

<p>He came and the cutlasses sounded amidst the air shoots
and the lianas, he destroyed nothing needlessly, pushing the
forest back where a path should go, making here a fairy
lake—less a lake than a mirror for the tree ferns to see
themselves in—here a glade, a twilit home for a statue. He
heard the murmur of the waterfall, whose voice still sounds
like a voice of mourning for the ruin of his work, and he
brought the waterfall into the scheme of things. You can
fancy how beautiful it was, this garden in the old day,
scented, languorous, sunlit, twilit, filled with the notes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
the bell bird and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">siffleur de montagne</i>, the whisper of
the trees and the voice of the waterfall.</p>

<p>As certainly as there were flowers in that garden there
were lovers; men fought and killed one another in the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">allée des duels</i>; what a volume of romance lay here brightly
written, vivid in colour, of which remains nothing but a
few torn leaves; faded pictures where the forest had half
blotted out the garden paths and the glades from which the
statues have vanished.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i> hides amidst the leaves and makes the
place frightful with death. He is the crowning fascination
of the ruined garden.</p>

<p>Gaspard, releasing the lips of the girl, and holding her
warm body close to him, kissed her eyes, her forehead, her
hair. Beyond the gates, the roadway like a great white
lamp burned in the sun trying to pierce the gloom. The
world seemed trying to peep at them, and the forest with
its great green sleeve to shelter them from the world.</p>

<p>“Come here—here!—here! forget the world and the
road—follow me where the ferns are high—into the twilight—come
here!—here!”</p>

<p>A <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">siffleur de montagne</i> in the gloom of the garden was
calling to his mate; they scarcely heard him yet they came,
taking a path on the left, a path hemmed on either side by
tree ferns and hundred feet soaring palms.</p>

<p>“You love me!”</p>

<p>“<em>Ché</em>—I have loved you since the world began.”</p>

<p>The reply held all the truth of love.</p>

<p>She had loved him since the world began. Aeons before
Martinique saw the white men from the East, in the dawn
of time, dim, cometic, her being had been projected towards
his, that she might stand in the Jardin des Plantes clasped
in the arms of Gaspard a million ancestors had lived and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
loved, and died; that he might stand clasping her in his
arms a million ancestors had fought the battle of life. This
embrace was the victory of the dead over death, the
triumph of life over time. In eight words she had spoken
the secret which all lovers feel vaguely in the depths of
their being. “I have loved you since the world began.”</p>

<p>The voice of the waterfall came now through the trees,
a burst of light shewed where the palms and angelines, the
ferns, and the ceibas, gave place to the lake into which the
torrent falls leaping, rainbowed, dim with mist from
amidst the foliage of the cliff; a hundred feet of cascading
water, every drop a gem. It seemed alive and laughing,
if water spirit ever lived she surely lived here. Then, as
they stood watching it, just as though the spirit had lost its
gaiety, the rainbow dazzle passed away and dimness spread
through the glade. The sun was sinking above the treetops.</p>

<p>Marie glanced up.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said, “the light is fading—ah, the sun,
could he not have waited a little longer! but he waits for
no one, not even for us.”</p>

<p>It was dark when they reached St. Pierre. The night
had welled up from the harbour like a flood, the moon was
up, and the stars alight in the dark pansy-blue above, but
Pelée’s crest still held a touch of sunlight. One might have
imagined the day standing there just before flight on that
burning crest. Then, spreading wings westward as the
light left the summit, leaving Martinique to night and the
stars.</p>

<p>All the way along the road from the Jardin des Plantes
the great fireflies had waltzed and drifted about them, they
had heard the first shuddering of the night wind in the
palms, they had paused to listen, the night had told them
things beyond the comprehension of all but lovers and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
poets. The Creole French of the tropics still hold a veil
between their minds, yet they understood one another
perfectly.</p>

<p>They came by the sea way, the harbour was full of stars
and the anchor lights of the ships in the bay, shone like
glow-worms, the red port-light of a steamer sent a red
ripple of light across the water. They could hear the wash
of the little waves against the sea-steps, and from out
there somewhere in the starlight the “creak-creak” of oars.</p>

<p>Some shore boat was putting off from a ship.</p>

<p>“See,” said Gaspard, “out there, that light near the
steamer, that is <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>.” He had told her on
their way back of how Sagesse had pushed forward the
expedition intending to start on Friday. The news had
been a blow to her—how hard a blow he did not guess, for
in the darkness he did not see the tears in her eyes, or the
quivering of her lips.</p>

<p>She looked across the water at the fateful light. It
seemed to her sinister, the eye of a <em>Zombi</em> staring straight
at her, malignant, and threatening.</p>

<p>“I am taking him away,” said the light, “beyond the rim
of the sea; you have seen the ships go there, great ships
that become little ships, and then just specks that vanish
utterly, just as people vanish when they die. Remember
Ti Finotte; she passed away like that, and the sun remains
and the blue sea, and sky, but she has not returned—she
will never come back. Yes, I am taking him away. I am
the <em>Zombi</em> who comes to take away happiness. I change my
form as <em>Zombis</em> do; you saw me once before, I was then the
coffin in which they placed Ti Finotte away there, amidst
the blowing palms of Morne Rouge, now I am the light that
will take away your love across the wind-blown sea.”</p>

<p>She turned to Gaspard, and casting her arms about his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
neck, pressing her face to his breast—sobbed. She could
keep a brave heart when he told her of his going, she could
keep the words back that would tell him of her despair,
but she could no longer control her tears. Fate had spoken
to her. That mind which knew nothing, knew everything.
In days long past, by the blue Caribbean Sea, the women of
her remote ancestry had seen their men going away, never,
perhaps, to return, and had clasped them like this. Grief,
who is ageless, had cast them upon the breasts of their
lovers. Just as in her love she had resumed their love, so
in her grief she was resuming their sorrow.</p>

<p>There by the starlit harbour of St. Pierre, this girl of
the people, clasping this man of the people, formed with
him a picture that the patient stars had watched for ages.
The story of love and separation told by two forms clinging
together—a vision statuesque, eternal.</p>

<p>“But I will come back—and it is not yet—not for some
days—”</p>

<p>“You will come back?”</p>

<p>“Ah, believe me, nothing will stop me—nothing—nothing.”</p>

<p>“It is so far—I do not know where. If I knew; but the
ships go away out there, and it is the distance that takes
my heart from me; they fade into nothing, pass into the
sky.”</p>

<p>“But they come back—you have seen the ships come
back?”</p>

<p>His voice told her that he was in trouble, and that it was
her grief that caused his trouble. She could not tell whether
the ships she had seen going away ever came back, the
sailing vessels were all alike to her. The American steamer
came back, but it was different from the others, but the
trouble in his voice made her dry her eyes and answer him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
“Yes—I had not thought of that, do not mind me, I am
foolish—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ché</i>, thou wilt surely return. The <i>Bon Dié</i> will
surely send you back to me.”</p>

<p>The boat that had been rowing across the harbour was
now at the steps near by, and a man was coming up the
steps. It was Sagesse. He did not notice them as he
walked away towards the town, but they saw him clearly.</p>

<p>Marie shuddered.</p>

<p>“Come,” said she, “how late it is—later than I have ever
been before, and the house will be closed.”</p>

<p>They turned, and by the Passage Bertine sought the
Street of the Precipice; there was not a soul to be seen, and
the moonlight was now pouring in the city.</p>

<p>The old street looked never more mysterious or beautiful
than by this light, brilliant, yet tinged with the suggestion
of death, and snow, and dreams. Had you seen Marie
standing at the door of the house where she lived, and
knocking for admittance, dressed as she was in her robe,
light, and graceful as the dress of some Athenian woman,
you might have fancied yourself far from the world of our
time, in some street of Mycenae—some moonlit street of
Taormina whence the flute-players had just vanished, leaving
behind them silence and the vision of Amaryllis at her
door.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SAILING OF LA BELLE ARLÉSIENNE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>At three o’clock on the fateful Friday morning Gaspard
was awakened from sleep by a knock at his door.</p>

<p>It was his landlady, Man’m Faly. She had promised to
wake him at three, for <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> would cast her
moorings and be away at four, if there was wind enough.
Mistrusting herself, the old lady had not gone to bed.</p>

<p>When he was dressed she returned with a cup of coffee
and a plate with a corrossole on it. She had known many
lodgers: mates, engineers from the French steamers, men
of all nationality, but she had never known one to please
her better than Gaspard. He never grumbled and he had
always a kind word. Besides, she knew, as half St. Pierre
knew, that Marie of Morne Rouge had found her man at
last, and that the man was Gaspard. The oldest woman on
earth is not too old to take interest in a love-affair, and
Man’m Faly was only sixty.</p>

<p>She stood by whilst he drank his coffee. He had paid
her the night before, and his few belongings were packed
in a canvas bag which she had found for him.</p>

<p>“Ah! well, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bon Dié</i> knows best, but we would none
of us have you go. But you will return, that is certain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I will return—one does not find such a city
every day, or such people. But there are storms and
chances—”</p>

<p>He took a packet from his pocket. It contained all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
money he had left from the payment he had received at
the shipping-office and the dollars Sagesse had paid him
for the gold coins. Though he had remembered the prayers
for Yves and paid for them, he had quite a respectable sum
left, for living at St. Pierre was very cheap, and Marie
had saved him from the vices on which foolish shipmen
squander their money.</p>

<p>“—and one never knows what may happen. See here;
there is some money in this packet. It is for the little one,
should anything happen to me. For Marie, she whom you
saw with me yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I will keep it,” said Man’m Faly.</p>

<p>She took the packet and he took up his bag. He cast
his eyes round the room. It was bare and poorly furnished,
but he had been happy there; in all his wandering life he
had never known such happiness; the pure, simple, clean
happiness of childhood.</p>

<p>A minute later, he was in the street.</p>

<p>The Rue du Morne framed with its houses a glimpse of
the sea, and the upper half of a great moon just sinking
beyond the sea-line.</p>

<p>He had said good-bye to Marie on the evening before.
His heart was heavy in him; it seemed to him now, as he
came down the steep street to the harbour side, that he was
leaving Paradise and leaving it forever. The coloured city
of St. Pierre, the pleasant people, the easy life—where
would he find a city like that in the whole wide world?</p>

<p>And <span class="locked">Marie—</span></p>

<p>He was standing now on the quay-side by the steps.
This was the steps where he had told the boat to meet him
at daybreak. It was almost due, for the moon had sunk
now completely, and in a moment Pelée would be drawing
his silhouette against the ice-blue sky of dawn. The wind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
was faint, just a breathing of air. Out there, beyond the
shelter of the island, the southeast trades would be blowing,
but here there was scarcely wind enough to move a
vessel through the water.</p>

<p>As he listened to the wash of the waves against the sea-steps,
he heard the steady creaking of oars. It was the
boat from <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>At four o’clock Marie left the house in the street of the
Precipice. This was not a working day with her. To-morrow,
the day after, the day after that—all time lay before
her to work in. To-day, the saddest day in her life, would
be a holiday.</p>

<p>As she passed slowly uphill through the awakening city,
she could hear the heavy shutters being flung open, voices,
the crowing of a cock from far away somewhere towards the
Rue Buonaparte.</p>

<p>This morning, away in the blue sky of dawn, the crest
of Mont Pelée, touched already by sun-rays, was an extraordinary
sight. The cloud turban, tormented by some wind
of the higher air, was streaming upwards in tongues of
misty light; the great mountain seemed to fume—one
might have fancied it topped by a burning cresset, some
signal-fire lit by giants or gods.</p>

<p>She reached the Rue Vauclin. It was already nearly
day, and the road was filled with people going to work.
From the Rue Victor Hugo below the Creole cries of the
street-vendors were already sounding; people gave her
good-day as she passed them, and she answered them, and
kept on.</p>

<p>Five minutes more brought her to the road to Morne
Rouge. Here she paused and, leaning on the wall on the
seaward side of the road, looked down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
She was looking at a sight that many people would have
crossed the world to see—the bay of St. Pierre unfolding
to the most lovely morning that ever came from heaven.
She saw nothing but <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>.</p>

<p>The old barquentine had shaken out her canvas and on
the strengthening breeze was stealing out to sea like a thief.
The bay was still in half twilight, though beyond the bay
the sea was alive with the sun.</p>

<p>One might have thought for a moment that <i>La Belle
Arlésienne</i> was not moving; a moment more, and you would
have seen the distance widening between her and the steamer
anchored to starboard of her.</p>

<p>The girl shaded her eyes with both her hands; then she
cast her arms out as if to clutch back some figure in the
air that was leaving her; then, leaning on the wall, she
looked.</p>

<p>As the day grew stronger, the vision of <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>
grew more remote.</p>

<p>Infinite distance seemed drawing her away, slowly, almost
imperceptibly; now a ship, now a tiny boat, now a
speck vanishing in the sun-dazzle above the azure.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<span class="subhead">PEDRO</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Gaspard, leaning on the taffrail, watched Martinique
dwindling in the sun-blaze and sea-dazzle. Dominica, to
eastward, stood vague, and ghostly on the horizon; to westward
the sea showed nothing but the purple of an infinite
pansy, an ocean of St. Estèphe or Macon blazed upon by
the fiercest light of the tropics.</p>

<p>Sagesse was standing by the negro who was at the wheel,
and <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> was heading nor’ nor’-west on a
course that would take her to westward of St. Kitts and
past the Virgin Islands. Here Sagesse would steer a west-nor’-west
course. It would be a quicker passage than in
coming, for they had now with them the South Equatorial
current.</p>

<p>Gaspard, as he turned from the taffrail, heard Sagesse
give an order for the hands to man the lee braces. They
were beyond the shelter of the island now, and the steady
blow of the trades was bending <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> over
gently, as though a great hand were playing with her.
“Now I will capsize you,” would sigh the voice to which
the hand belonged, speaking with a deep hum through the
taut, twanging rigging, whilst <i>La Belle</i> would bend like an
old coquette to the gentle pressure, till, with a groan of
the rudder and a dash of sparkling spray, she would remember
herself and come to a more even keel.</p>

<p>Gaspard had noticed the number of the crew when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
came on board; besides Sagesse and Jules there were ten
hands, all negroes, large, well set-up men, well fitted for
the arduous work before them, with the exception of one,
an undersized, shifty-eyed and depressed-looking individual
from Porto Rico.</p>

<p>“Ten,” said Gaspard to himself, as he counted them.
“With Sagesse and Jules that makes twelve, and with me
thirteen. Thirteen, and we start on a Friday, and we
expect luck!”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Regardez</i>,” said Sagesse, ranging up beside him and
indicating the crew. “They are not a bad lot; all but that
Porto Rican—he is new to me and does not know our ways.
We will make a better man of him before the voyage is
over. Look how Jules handles them.”</p>

<p>After Sagesse, Jules was the ruling spirit on board the
barquentine. He had never to repeat an order, and he was
a man much more after Gaspard’s heart than Sagesse; yet
he was tainted by Sagesse and, most evidently his slave.</p>

<p>There was only one other person beside Gaspard on
board who did not bend entirely to the eye of the redoubtable
Captain, and that was the Porto Rican. This individual
obeyed orders in a surly manner, and Sagesse watched him
with a brooding eye.</p>

<p>“We will make a better man of him before the voyage is
over,” said he again, as he turned from the hands who
were being dismissed, and stood for a moment looking to
windward at the blue ghost of Dominica.</p>

<p>Gaspard said nothing.</p>

<p>He did not even remark on the unlucky number of the
crew. He had imbibed the teaching of M. Seguin with
regard to Sagesse, and he felt that in this voyage, so filled
as it was with the possibilities of wealth, things might
happen of a disastrous nature, and that silence and watchfulness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
were essential. He did not in the least know that
Sagesse, under the delusion that his plans had been betrayed
to M. Seguin, had sworn to be even with him (Gaspard).
He knew nothing of this, but something warned
him to be silent, civil as possible to this extraordinary man,
and on the look-out. On that day, in fact, began a duel of
intelligence between these two men, the ending of which
none could forecast from the nature of the men themselves.</p>

<p>The expedition had been so rushed that Sagesse felt dissatisfied
in his mind as to the stowage and condition of
some of the most important gear. The diving-dresses,
pumps, tubes and boring instruments were accordingly
brought on deck after dinner from the lockers where they
had been stowed.</p>

<p>Sagesse, who knew a little of everything, and whose
natural genius and commonsense supplied most deficiencies
in his knowledge, had the pump taken to pieces and each
piece greased thick and wrapped in canvas; the metal parts
of the diving-dresses were treated with the same care, only
in a different manner; the dresses themselves, the air tubes,
the whole gear down to the least detail came bit by bit
under his careful inspection and received as much attention
as possible to protect it from the influence of the sea air
and the tropical rot that touches all things from metal to
morals.</p>

<p>At eight bells (four o’clock) Gaspard, who had retired
to his bunk for a doze, was awakened by a cry from the deck.
He had left the door of his cabin wide open and the deck-house
door being also open, he could see the white, sunlit
deck, the figure of Sagesse, the figures of several of the
crew and something lying on the deck before Sagesse. He
tumbled out of his bunk and came through the deck-house
into the sunlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Sagesse was holding a belaying-pin in his hand, and the
thing on the deck before him was the Porto Rican, Pedro.</p>

<p>The man was covered with blood from a wound in the
forehead. He was just raising himself on one hand as
Gaspard came on the scene, and he looked dazed, like a
person awakening from sleep. Next moment, he was
scrambling on to his feet, literally kicked on to them by
Sagesse, and making for the fo’cs’le, where he disappeared,
followed by a shout of laughter from the men on deck.</p>

<p>“That will teach him,” said the Captain, flinging the
belaying-pin in the weather scupper and wiping his brow
with his coat-sleeve; then, as he turned, he saw Gaspard
and started slightly. His face wore an expression of chill
ferocity quite new to Gaspard; it was as though the devil
in the man had taken possession of his features for a moment—a
moment only, for the next he was laughing and
himself again.</p>

<p>“Bah!” said he. “I believe the scamp made me lose my
temper.” He stepped to the weather rail, shaded his eyes
and looked over the sea. Dominica had vanished, painted
out by distance; a star of light on the far horizon indicated
the topsails of a ship hull down beyond the sea-line; nothing
else was to be seen.</p>

<p>“We’ll see no more land till we touch the Virgins,” said
Sagesse. “From there to your island, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">compère</i> Gaspard, is,
as near as I can make it, three hundred and sixty miles;
from here to the Virgins is a matter of two hundred and
ninety, so you can add the sums together, and you will
know the length of your road.”</p>

<p>“What are we doing?”</p>

<p>“Eight knots.”</p>

<p>“When will we get there?”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bon Dieu</i>, how you talk! We are in the hands of the
wind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Gaspard filled his pipe and lit it, Sagesse, leaning
against the bulwarks, lit a Martinique <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bout</i> and with his
hands in his pockets looked lazily over the sea.</p>

<p>“See here,” said Gaspard, after a moment’s silence.
“Suppose we reach that place all right, and suppose we find
stuff there—”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Well, how are we to get rid of it?”</p>

<p>Sagesse laughed.</p>

<p>“You are one of those that look far ahead. So am I.
Suppose we find stuff there, well, who does it belong to but
us? We have located it, we have got an expedition together
to find it, the island belongs to no government, the stuff belonged
to people who were dead when you and I were
born. The stuff belongs to us by all right. Is that not so?”</p>

<p>“As you put it, yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, my friend, there is no such thing as Right in this
world. As soon as it is known that we have found the old
money-box, broken her open and taken the contributions,
some government will say, ‘That island is mine,’ some man
will rise up with a lying charter, proving that he bought
the island and the ship years ago, some rascal trick will be
played by some rascal, and we will have law-suits; the stuff
will be impounded, witnesses will be brought from the ends
of the world to bear false witness, our characters will be
enquired into—” Sagesse laughed as he spoke, crossed the
deck to the lee rail, spat into the sea, and returned. “They
will say, these lawyer-men, ‘who is this Monsieur Sagesse
who finds old treasure-ships? Let’s hunt up all about him,
and if we can’t find anything against him, let us make
something against him.’ No, my friend, I wish to have
nothing to do with the law; nothing to do with governments;
nothing to do with enemies on this occasion. So,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
being a man who looks ahead, I have already made my
plans for disposing of the stuff in America—” Sagesse
came to a dead stop. His habit of talking had got possession
of him and carried him further than he meant to go.</p>

<p>“In America?”</p>

<p>“There, or somewhere else.”</p>

<p>At this moment Jules came out of the fo’cs’le, where only
a few minutes before Pedro had disappeared, and came
along the deck to Sagesse. He spoke a couple of words in
an undertone, and Sagesse following him they both went
forward.</p>

<p>Gaspard watched them vanishing down the fo’cs’le hatch.
The thought that Pedro had been seriously injured crossed
his mind for a moment, but his mind, filled with the words
of Sagesse, had no room for thoughts about Pedro. America!
If they had to go to America to dispose of the stuff,
the voyage might last months, and to Gaspard the few hours
that had passed since losing sight of Martinique seemed
months. He had found all he wanted in life, and he had
left it behind him there in Martinique.</p>

<p>As he stood waiting for Sagesse to return and finish the
conversation, he saw Marie again just as he had seen her
that day on the cliff at Grande Anse, the sea wind fluttering
her robe and the sun clasping her little head between his
two great golden hands.</p>

<p>Then Sagesse appeared, returning from the fo’cs’le, but
he did not seem in a humour to continue the conversation.</p>

<p>He seemed disturbed in his mind about something.</p>

<p>That night when Gaspard was on deck, smoking a pipe
before turning in, he heard the sound of laughter coming
from away forward.</p>

<p>There was no light on deck but the light of the binnacle
lamp and a glimmer from a crack in the deck-house door
which was closed, and out of the darkness away forward
came this sudden shock of laughter, not loud, but hard,
mirthless, and inhuman.</p>

<p>If a fiend had dropped from the sky and stridden the
bowsprit, he might have emitted such a laugh at <i>La Belle
Arlésienne</i>, her captain, her crew, and her venture before
putting his blight upon the vessel and whooping into the
sea.</p>

<p>Gaspard glanced at the steersman. He was a big negro,
naked to his waist in the hot night, a colossal figure touched
by the binnacle light. Whether he heard or whether he
did not hear it was impossible to say; he shewed neither
sign nor movement, with the exception of the movement of
the great right hand upon the wheel spoke, now visible,
now fleeting into darkness.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pardieu!</i>” muttered Gaspard to himself, “the fellow
that made that laugh would not make the pleasantest companion.
Let us listen—”</p>

<p>He leaned on the bulwark rail.</p>

<p>The hot southeast trade wind coming out of the velvety<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
darkness whispered in the shrouds and set the reef points
pattering; the warm, windy, starry night had a perfume
more than the perfume of the sea; some trace of scent
from the gardens and forests of Dominica, some hint of
the spices of Guadaloupe hung on the skirts of the wind.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, from forward came again the
voice, not laughing this time.</p>

<p class="in0">The chanty of the negroes when they were breaking the
cargo out of <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> sung by that single
cracked voice. Now, the negro sailor, or the white, for
the matter of that, never sings a working chanty for the
pleasure of the thing. Who was this, then, breaking imaginary
cargo or tramping at the capstan bars of some visionary
vessel?</p>

<p>The deck-house door opened and a burst of light flooded
the deck.</p>

<p>Sagesse stood for a moment framed in the doorway.
He seemed listening to the voice from forward; then he
saw Gaspard and called him to come into the deck-house.</p>

<p>A case bottle of rum was on the table, two glasses, and a
pitcher of water; one of the glasses held some rum in it.
Sagesse had evidently been drinking by himself. His face
had a grey tinge; something had evidently disturbed him.</p>

<p>He shut the door, filled a glass for Gaspard, placed a
box of cigars on the table, all without a word; then he took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
his seat at the table and began talking of the voyage in the
desultory manner of a man who wishes to make conversation.</p>

<p>Now and again, as he talked, he ceased, as if to listen.
Now, there was nothing to be heard but the voice of the
ship, the creak of block and stanchion, the hundred small
tongues by which the vessel speaks. Then, thin and far
away, would come the other voice:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">A Fort de France, Ay ho!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">thin, weary, the ghost of a sound.</p>

<p>Gaspard knew now all at once, from Sagesse’s manner,
that the singer was Pedro, that the man was delirious, probably
dying.</p>

<p>But he said nothing. Pedro, what he had seen of him,
was a hang-dog looking scoundrel; he did not feel very
much interested in his fate, though hating the idea that he
had been brutally knocked about. What absorbed his attention
now was the manner of Sagesse.</p>

<p>The Captain had filled his glass, finished it, and filled
again; he talked incessantly, and the talk seemed to intoxicate
him as much as the rum; the more intoxicated he grew
the less did he care about the matter which had been on
his mind.</p>

<p>Then, at length, he rose to his feet and flung the deck-house
door open for air. He stood for a moment in the
doorway, as if listening; but there was nothing to hear, for
the voice had ceased.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FO’CS’LE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Next day Sagesse shewed signs neither of his intoxication
of the past night nor of the worry that had preceded it.
Neither did the deck shew sign of Pedro.</p>

<p>Was the man dead, or was he lying in his hammock,
recovering from his injuries? It was impossible to say; the
faces of the crew told nothing.</p>

<p>The weather was perfect, blue and warm, and <i>La Belle
Arlésienne</i>, with every rag of canvas set, was making good
way.</p>

<p>If a ship could develop a character, one might have fancied
<i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> infected with the character of
Sagesse; at least so it seemed to Gaspard. There was
something stealthy and almost underhand in this old tramp
of the ocean. He could remember, the first day he sighted
her hull down on the horizon, how she had grown upon the
sky-line, how she had come towards him as he lay drifting
in the open boat like an angel to his rescue, and then, the
light and wind dying with the sunset, how she had all at
once seemed to forget him.</p>

<p>How she had vanished for a moment in the darkness, and
then had come stealing along in the starlight.</p>

<p>She was sixty years old, and more, built in Havannah in
the early forties; age was telling against her, and it may
have been the touch of age, added to the cut of her ill-fitting
sails and some trend in her build, that gave her distinction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
over other ships. Who knows? But the fact remains
that she was a “character,” picturesque in any port of the
world, and romantic with a suggestion of villainy and
deceit.</p>

<p>But to-day she moved with a freedom and youthfulness,
as though rejoicing in the depths of her old heart at the
business on hand.</p>

<p>At eight bells, four o’clock, there was still no sign of
Pedro on deck, nor word about him. Sagesse was nowhere
to be seen, the deck-house door was closed, and Gaspard
determined on a bold stroke.</p>

<p>He must verify his suspicions. If Pedro had been done
to death by Sagesse it was important for him to have first-hand
knowledge of the fact, which would be a weapon
against this villain should he give trouble in the future.</p>

<p>He went forward, passing the green-painted bell from
which one of the crew had just rung out the hour.</p>

<p>Several of the hands were on deck, but not Jules. This
man, though he was mate and had a knowledge of navigation
sufficient to work the vessel, berthed in the fo’cs’le
with the others. He was no doubt there.</p>

<p>Now, the fo’cs’le of a ship is sacred to the hands. It is
entered by the ship’s officers rarely, and only on extraordinary
occasions. Gaspard knew this fact, but the knowledge
did not deter him.</p>

<p>He went to the fo’cs’le hatch, and descended the ladder
into gloom and a stifling atmosphere.</p>

<p>It was a roomy enough place, as fo’cs’les go, and considering
the tonnage of <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>, but all the
winds of heaven could never have purged it of the scent of
blackbeetles and negroes. The slush lamps that had lit it
for sixty years, the tobacco, from Perique to twist, that
had been smoked there, the men, from Dagoes to Africans,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
who had lived there, all had left a reminiscence, a taint,
almost one might say a colour.</p>

<p>Bunks lined the sides; there was only one hammock, it
belonged to Jules; only one sea-chest, Jules’; the rest of
the crew did not trouble about luggage very much—a knotted
handkerchief or an old fish-mat serving them for bags
and chests. The bunks ran up to where the heel of the
bowsprit came into the place between the knightheads.</p>

<p>There were five men here, all asleep; Jules in his hammock
and the four others in bunks; naked, for they had
kicked off the last of their clothes in the stifling heat; and
looking like bronze figures cast by some fantastic sculptor,
fresh from the mould, and flung here and there to cool.</p>

<p>Pedro was not here.</p>

<p>Gaspard carefully verified the fact. The man must have
died in the night and been cast overboard like a dog. There
could be no doubt of the fact, for on <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>
there was no other place where he could be but here, unless
he were stowed in the lazarette, in the caboose, in the
harness cask or shot down the main hatch. Overboard was
a much more tenable supposition. The thing had probably
been done before dawn, and as Gaspard recognised the fact
and looked around him at these grim figures lost in sleep,
his own position on board, should anything bring him into
opposition with Sagesse, came before him vividly.</p>

<p>Without clothes, naked, and barbaric, lit by the dim rays
of the swinging lamp, here were the men who would give
him short shrift and a plunge in the sea at the word of
their commander. Pedro was one of themselves, yet they
had made no opposition to his murder.</p>

<p>As he stood looking, a man in one of the starboard bunks
tossed his arms and moved in his sleep. Gaspard did not
wait. A moment later he was on deck. He had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
lucky; the cook who had been in the caboose had not left
it, the men on deck, all except the man at the wheel, were
lazing in the afternoon sunshine. Three of them were
seated with their backs to the after part of the main hatch,
chewing tobacco, and yarning; he could see the tops of
their heads and hear their voices yaw-yawing, their laughter
and an occasional oath; two were leaning over the side
of the vessel to leeward, yarning, and spitting into the sea.</p>

<p>The door of the deck-house was still closed. There was
no lookout forward, the individual who ought to have been
the eyes of the ship was leaning over the rail to leeward.</p>

<p>Discipline in this respect was rather lax on board <i>La
Belle Arlésienne</i>. She took chances in fine weather; she
seemed blind very often, yet she found her way about,
rarely making a serious mistake. Gaspard imagined that
the crew of this blind and easy-going vessel were unobservant
and that his expedition into the fo’cs’le had passed
unnoticed. In this he was wrong.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE REVOLVER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Three days later, in a pink and pearl dawn, they passed
the Virgin Islands, their shoals and sand spits.</p>

<p>By eight o’clock the islands were just palms low down on
the sea, swimming in an azure haze; they had vanished
completely before noon.</p>

<p>Not a word had been said by Sagesse about Pedro, and
Gaspard imagined that the captain held off the subject
under the impression that he (Gaspard) had forgotten the
Porto Rican’s existence.</p>

<p>There was something almost uncanny in this vanishing
of a man and the utter indifference of all on board. Imagination
embroidered upon the situation and asked questions
not the less disturbing because they were unanswerable.</p>

<p>Had the wretched man died in his bunk, delirious from
brain fever following the injury, or had he been flung
overboard before death?</p>

<p>The imaginative mind of Gaspard found much to play
with in this idea. He pictured the business done in the
small hours of the morning, whilst he was asleep. He
dreamed of it at night.</p>

<p>Pedro became an obsession with him, just as the dead
Yves had become an obsession on the island. What had
happened to this man whom he had seen alive and well,
yet who had gone off the ship without a word?</p>

<p>He <em>knew</em> that Pedro had been killed by the blow of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
belaying-pin, just as on the island he had known that Yves
was dead amidst the bushes; but imagination takes little
heed of facts once she gets rein, and incessantly he was
haunted by the idea of the vanished man; the chanty he
had been singing in his delirium clung like a ghostly echo
to the ship.</p>

<p>This trouble of the imagination was not eased by the
conditions of his life on board, the absolute idleness and
the presence at all times of Sagesse. He was passing
swiftly from dislike to hatred of Sagesse.</p>

<p>On this day of their passing the Virgin Islands his ill-temper
and irritability had come to a crisis, and it was only
by keeping away from his companion that he could hold
himself in check. He had been silent at breakfast, but the
Captain did not seem to notice his silence. All during the
morning he had kept as much as possible to himself, smoking,
leaning over the side, watching the indigo-blue water
swirling past, the flakes of foam, the flying-fish, the sun
dazzles, the floating seaweeds. There were tiny fish following
<i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> close to the rudder, as if for
protection; sometimes these would dart away from the ship
and back again, needle-bright and swift. A glancing blue
and gold form appeared and hovered for a moment in view;
beneath it appeared what seemed the trace of a sand-spit,
vague, misty, and moving as though to keep pace with the
ship. It was a shark, and the blue and gold angel of the
sea was its pilot. They vanished. Sharks do not follow
nigger ships, they say. Gaspard did not know or care; he
watched the depths like a man mesmerised, seeing, scarcely
seeing, not caring what he saw. He was thinking of Marie,—Marie
of Morne Rouge, from whom this cursed ship was
taking him moment by moment further away and against
his will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
He was brought back from his thoughts by one bell striking
and by the shadow of the cook bearing dinner from the
galley to the deck-house.</p>

<p>Canned beef stewed with carrots formed the repast, with
the eternal bananas of the tropics. Sagesse was hungry,
and therefore silent. Gaspard was silent, but he was not
hungry.</p>

<p>The sight of this man, whom he was beginning to loathe,
at his food would have taken his appetite away had he
possessed one. The meal went on in silence, and Sagesse
was pushing his plate away, and had reached out his hand
for the bottle to fill his glass, when Gaspard leaned across
the table.</p>

<p>“I counted the crew when I came on board,” said Gaspard,
“and it seems to me that I made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“How so?” asked Sagesse, helping himself from the
bottle.</p>

<p>“I counted eleven hands which, with you and me, would
make thirteen souls on board.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sagesse, helping himself from the glass,
“what of that?”</p>

<p>“Thirteen was an unlucky number.”</p>

<p>“So you believe in that nonsense?”</p>

<p>“Do not you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, look—what has happened since we started?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that I know of.”</p>

<p>“Think!”</p>

<p>Gaspard was working himself up, impulse and imagination
were laying their hands on him; he forgot safety, he
forgot Marie, he forgot even himself in the anger of his
soul before this smooth-faced scoundrel, this cold calculator
of chances, this murderer with the soul of a store-keeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
“Think!—a man has been lost already off this ship.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” said Sagesse, his hand falling from his glass
to the pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>“Murdered, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mordieu</i>!” said the other, who was now
white to the lips.</p>

<p>Next moment he had flung himself across the table. He
was not a second too soon. Sagesse had drawn a revolver
from his pocket; it was a stupid act and unlike him, but his
strange character, so antagonistic as a rule to anger and
violence, had become infected with the rage of his vis-a-vis;
he felt, perhaps, that Gaspard in surprising his deed had
now a hold upon him, that the crew, bowed by his will as
they were, would, if brought before one of those infernal
examining magistrates, inevitably break down, contradict
each other and give him away. Anger, uppermost in his
mind for a second, dictated the attempt to destroy this witness.
But Gaspard was too quick for him. He had seized
him by the wrist with an iron grip, the muzzle of the revolver
was pointing to the roof of the deck-house. The whole
thing had happened in a flash, with scarcely a sound, and
had you looked in through the door you might have fancied
the two men were larking. But a second glance would have
shown you that Gaspard, half lying across the table, had
seized a knife in his left hand.</p>

<p>“Drop it,” said Gaspard, “or, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sang-Dieu</i>, I will drive this
through your heart—assassin!”</p>

<p>Sagesse, whose anger had vanished, released his clutch
on the revolver. It fell on the table, and Gaspard, seizing
it, resumed his seat.</p>

<p>Sagesse, rising from his, went quietly to the door, which
was half open, closed it, and turned to his companion.</p>

<p>“We are fools,” he said. “Sit down. I am not coming
near you. But to quarrel like this—we are fools!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
“I may be a fool, but I am not a murderer.”</p>

<p>Sagesse pointed to the knife that had fallen on the table,
and laughed as he re-took his seat.</p>

<p>“Maybe not, but it seems to me you were handy enough
with that knife a moment ago. I did not say you were a
fool alone; I said we were fools quarrelling in the after guard,
with a crew like this and treasure ahead. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon
Dieu</i> only knows if we may not be fighting together for our
lives before long, if we are lucky, and if those black beasts
choose to rise up against us. Do you know that my position
here is not so much the master of a ship as the master
of a menagerie? You got the better of me for a moment.
I did not intend to shoot you. I drew in anger, I gave way
for a second to that child’s passion. That was a fault, but
I mastered it. But suppose—look you here—suppose one
of those animals had come in and found us at grips, and
you holding me like that, where would my authority have
been? And, I tell you, it is by authority only that you and
I will live through this business, for the fellows forward
have hell in them, and they only want pricking to let it out.</p>

<p>“You say a man has gone overboard. Well, that is my
business, and it is better that one man should go than that
we should have our throats cut. That fellow was full of
mutiny, and I sent him where he’d got to go sooner or later.
That’s my business. And now hand me over that revolver.
Or stay—” He went to his cabin and came back in a
moment with another revolver. He handed it to Gaspard.</p>

<p>“It’s loaded. I brought it for you in case we had trouble
with these fellows. You can take it now and give me back
mine.”</p>

<p>Gaspard opened the breech. It was loaded. He handed
Sagesse’s weapon back to him, and Sagesse put it in his
pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
“Now,” said Sagesse, “let us be friends till this business
is over. That is to say, let us work together, for if we do
not, we will pull nothing out of the fire—and I can tell you
this, we have our work cut out before us.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand, and Gaspard took it; but there
was no friendship in the grip, only policy.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />

<span class="subhead">THE VISION OF TREASURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>From that day Sagesse’s manner changed. One might
have fancied that the man’s nature had changed; a friendliness
and a bonhomie never exhibited before appeared in
his tone and conversation. Gaspard’s simple and somewhat
primitive mind rejected the first overtures towards this
better understanding; he suspected treachery; but the manner
of the captain was so uniformly equable and sustained
that the primitive mind could not but fall under its spell.</p>

<p>No man could act friendship like that and keep the
acting up, thought Gaspard; and in this he was perhaps
right. Sagesse had the power of closing a door on all
sorts of passions and hanging the key up; just as a visitor
to an hotel hangs the key of his room up, forgetting it; or
rather putting it out of his mind till, the business of the
day over, he remembers the key and enters his room.</p>

<p>At nights, over rum and water, smoking Martinique
cigars, without his coat, seated at the table in his shirt-sleeves
like the prosperous landlord of some Provençal
auberge, Sagesse would give rein to his tongue and imagination.
Treasure, now, was his entire theme, or
nearly so.</p>

<p>“Mark you,” he would say, “I have been trading in these
waters now for thirty years and more, and this is the first
treasure-ship business I have taken up, because it is the
first time I have seen the chance of profit. Yes, I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
had hundreds of knaves and fools coming to me with ‘locations.’
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mordieu</i>, I have had men bring me ‘locations’ in
five hundred fathom water, in channels where any fool
would know the rush of the tide made working impossible,
over reefs that a child might guess would saw a
ship asunder in six months—but here we have a thing perfectly
new, a ship lying in a few fathoms of still water,
tucked away safe for us. Of course, she may have been
visited and sacked years ago, but I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“For this reason: If she is Serpente’s ship, she has
been lying there a great many years, under water all the
time, with water deep enough to prevent salvage unless
with diving apparatus, and they hadn’t diving apparatus
handy in those days. If people had got at her recently,
they would have dynamited her. She would not be lying
there so quietly, take my word for it, if the Americans or
the Spaniards had smelt her out.”</p>

<p>“You think she is really Serpente’s ship?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that he was really a man like what
Monsieur Jaques made out?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Ma foi!</i> why—if he was like what Monsieur Jaques
said, he would have been unlike any other man.”</p>

<p>“Which he was,” replied Sagesse. “Now, look you here.
One may listen to old wives’ tales by the hour and get
no profit, but when one gets an old wife’s tale repeated
and repeated, and always the same, one may claim there
is truth in it. The stories and the pictures of Serpente
all tally—why, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mordieu</i>, you yourself have seen his skull,
which I hope to find and keep as a curiosity.”</p>

<p>“As for me,” said Gaspard, “I never want to see the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
thing again. I do not care what you say about old wives’
tales, but I believe this, that Serpente was the devil in
the form of a man—”</p>

<p>“Or a child,” laughed Sagesse, “or a monkey, for he
wasn’t bigger—in his head-piece, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“—monkey or child or man, what I have said I have
said. He was the devil, or as much of himself as the
devil could stuff into such a carcase, and if he lets us
off that island with the gold, all I can say is, the devil’s
dead or gone out of business.”</p>

<p>Sagesse laughed, and lit another cigar, and turned the
subject. He felt a profound contempt for the superstition
of Gaspard, but he did not shew it.</p>

<p>On the morning of the seventh day out he came up to
Gaspard, who was sitting on the main hatch, took his
seat beside him, and unrolled a small chart.</p>

<p>“We ought to be there to-morrow, shortly after sun-up,
if this wind holds,” said Sagesse, spreading the chart on
his knee. “I got this from Jaques; it’s a French Admiralty
chart of Turks Island and the Caicos, at least a bit of it;
the whole thing was as big as a blanket and I cut this
piece out. The <i>Diane</i>—she was a French cruiser—included
our island when she was out here ten years ago
taking soundings. She little thought how useful it would
be to us.”</p>

<p>Gaspard looked at the chart. There was the island,
no bigger than a sixpence, the reefs and shoals all carefully
mapped out. It gave him a strange sensation to
see this picture of the place that for him had the
mystery of dreamland attached to it; there were times
when he half believed the island to be non-existent and
that <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>, sail the blue sea as far as she
might, would never raise that landfall. Yet here it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
pictured out by men who had visited the spot ten years
before he had landed there.</p>

<p>It had been waiting there all these years for him, to shew
him the meaning of desolation and Death, just as the little
Place de la Fontaine had been waiting for him to shew him
Love.</p>

<p>Ah! those places that wait for us since the time we
were born! the places where we part with and meet the
people we love, the place where we shall lie down to
die!—we never reckon them amidst our friends and enemies;
yet what friends are more faithful, what enemies
more inexorable?</p>

<p>He looked attentively at the little picture. A hair’s-breadth
beyond the southern edge he knew that the body
of Yves was lying amidst the bay-cedar bushes, in the
middle, there, the bones of Serpente, just beyond the
northern edge, the ship of coral patient in the green
lagoon; that tiny spur to southward was the place where
he stood when he first felt the haunting “grue,” and from
there he had swum to the boat. The sea gulls would still
be flying over those reefs to the southeast, calling wheeling,
<span class="locked">fishing.—</span></p>

<p>“It’s all clear water to westward,” said Sagesse. “Ten
fathom close in shore; we can anchor there; sandy beach,
you told me it was, to southward—are you sure?”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i> Sure! If you had been there, as I was,
you would be sure.” He had grown so friendly with
Sagesse in the last few days that he could talk about
intimate things to him, and with southern vehemence he
began to paint rapidly in words the horror of that time,
lost, locked away by the sea on that spot where the wind
and the sun and the silence were conspirators with
madness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Sagesse listened, and never did a man seem more
friendly and interested than Captain Pierre Sagesse, as
he sat on the main hatch of <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>, listening
to the tale of the man whom he had sworn in his heart
to be revenged on; but not by the brutal methods of ordinary
revenge that would have satisfied an ordinary man.</p>

<p>That night Gaspard did not join Sagesse in his rum-and-water;
he smoked his pipe on deck. The moon would
not rise till after midnight, and though the stars were
unclouded they were paled to insignificance by the sea.
<i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> seemed sailing through an ocean of
liquid phosphorus. The sea burned white, dimly glowing
in the distance like a snow-covered country, brightly glowing
at the ship’s side, and furiously smouldering in the
wake; it was the light of dead-wood, of corpse fires, of
things rotten, dismal as the light from the lake of Dante
where dwell the spirits of the damned.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock Gaspard went to his bunk; Sagesse, with
the prospect of a hard day’s work on the morrow, was
already in his and snoring. The deck was in charge of
Jules.</p>

<p>For a long time Gaspard could not sleep, haunted by
the thoughts of the morrow. Notwithstanding his hatred
of the island and his half-formed resolve to have no share
in the treasure, the treasure had already laid ghostly
hands upon him. No man can withstand the fascination
of the near presence of free gold. Men may be cold to
women, to wine, to sin, but gold hidden and to be had for
the finding is a magnet for <em>all</em> men, even as it was for
Gaspard. He had been brooding upon it all day, and
now, as he lay in his bunk, it chased away sleep; it
made him forget Marie.</p>

<p>It would seem that this fatal island had the power of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
casting him from his proper path. Here for the sake of
the gold in the belt he had forgotten his brotherhood to
Yves, here for the sake of the gold in the ship he was
forgetting his love for the woman who loved him.</p>

<p>A week ago he had no thought for the treasure; four
days ago he had little thought of it; yesterday it was
beginning to haunt his dreams; to-night it had him in its
grip. The nearer they came to it, the stronger grew the
attraction.</p>

<p>As he lay in his bunk he saw sacks large as corn-sacks
bursting with napoleons; he saw jewels such as he had
seen in the shop windows of Marseilles; he saw wealth,
not as a power to be used, but in its crude form of wealth.
And this is how Serpente had seen it, and all these lousy
pirates, who, incapable of using gold except in a tavern
or a gambling-hell, ransacked the Caribbean, slew men,
and with the wealth of the Indies in their pockets found
peace at last in a noose.</p>

<p>He fell asleep, only to dream of gold, and he awoke
shortly before dawn with a dry mouth and a burning
forehead.</p>

<p>He came on deck. Sagesse had relieved Jules and was
standing by the man at the wheel. The moon, in her last
quarter, held the sea; she was low down on the horizon
and the stars above were bright and huge; the wind had
fallen to a gentle breathing, just filling the sails which
slatted now and then with a sound like the wing of a great
bird.</p>

<p>Gaspard spoke a word to Sagesse, and then went forward
a bit and leaned on the starboard bulwarks. He lit
a pipe. The slow way on the vessel irritated him. What
if the wind fell to a dead calm? It seemed almost impossible
that this was the man who had fled from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
place that he was now so anxious to reach, the man who
had tried to dissuade Sagesse from the venture which
now filled his being with fire and anxiety.</p>

<p>He leaned for a while smoking, motionless, in a reverie;
then, as if suddenly awakened to some disagreeable fact,
he started and smacked his hand on the bulwark.</p>

<p>“Fifteen per cent.! Fifteen francs out of every hundred
francs! <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Coquin de sort!</i> never! He thought he had
me tied up with Yves in fear of the law. Well, how
about Pedro? It seems to me if he threatens me with
Yves, I can threaten him with Pedro, and a ship’s company
to bear witness! Fifty per cent.! I will stick to
that. But I will say nothing yet.”</p>

<p>Now in the sky to eastward the darkness was paling
and stars that were there shining brightly a moment ago
had vanished.</p>

<p>Some atmospheric influence had caught the first faintest
sunrays and held them from spreading in a fan-shaped
haze, grey, then spreading to blue, luminous with fire. Almost
before one could say, “It is no longer night,” day
was coming over the sea like a golden breeze.</p>

<p>“Land ho! Ahoy! Ahee! Land ho!”</p>

<p>Thin, in the French of the colonies, came the cry from
the maintop, where Sagesse had stationed a hand.</p>

<p>Gaspard sprang on the bulwark and, clinging with one
hand to the ratlines of the mainmast, shaded his eyes with
the other hand and looked.</p>

<p><i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> was heading now N.N.W., and there,
away on the sky-line, traced as if with a fine brush, the
palm tops of Skeleton Island caught his eye. The beach
would be visible from the maintop, but from here one
could only see the trees as yet.</p>

<p>Gaspard, as he gazed, could hear the voice of Sagesse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
giving orders, the clicking of the rudder chains, and then
the palms swung slowly out of sight as the vessel altered
her course and jib and foresail clouded them.</p>

<p>He dropped on to the deck.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sagesse, coming up, “<i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>
is not late at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rendezvous</i>. She knows her way about,
does <i>La Belle</i>. We will be at our anchorage in an hour,
and then it will be <em>work</em>, my brave, for you and me.
Come, let us have breakfast. We’ll have little enough
time for meals once the anchor is down, for I intend to
have the boat and gear across that island by sunset; then
to-morrow morning the real business will begin.”</p>

<p>They passed into the deck-house, where the cook was
already laying the table, and were soon seated opposite
to one another before a dish of bananas fried with bacon
and a can of hot coffee.</p>

<p>They talked as they ate, and laughed. Sagesse, in the
highest spirits, sketched out his plan of campaign, and
Gaspard could not but admire the thoroughness of the man,
for he had forgotten nothing, and had thought out the
whole business to the minutest detail. Not only had a
boat to be fetched across the island to the lagoon and the
pump and gear to fix in the boat, but a shelter had to
be built in which to keep the diving-dresses and the perishable
rubber connections from the sun when not in use.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Sagesse, “this may be a job of weeks,
and we must land enough food for the working party right
off, so as not to be making journeys to the vessel. There
is water, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is a spring.”</p>

<p>“You told me you left a tent.”</p>

<p>“A boat sail we made a tent of.”</p>

<p>“It will do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
“Listen!” said Gaspard, suddenly turning his head and
half rising to his feet.</p>

<p>Through the open doorway of the deck-house thin,
faint, far away, came a lamentable sound.</p>

<p>It was the crying of gulls.</p>

<p>The men rose from the table and came out on deck.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV<br />

<span class="subhead">THE LANDING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The island, close to them now and on the starboard bow,
lay burning coral-white and sage-green on the blue sea.</p>

<p>One could see the palms bending to the breeze, and
the snow of the surf and the white flicker of the gulls,
whose voices came, now and then, weak and spirit-like,
across the water.</p>

<p>Something fluttering beneath the palms drew Gaspard’s
attention; he borrowed Sagesse’s glass and looked. It
was the remains of the tent, a few rags of canvas; they
seemed beckoning to him like brown hands, skeleton-thin
and sinister.</p>

<p>Even as he looked, the roar of the anchor-chain through
the hawse pipe tore the air, and <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> swung
at her moorings in eight fathoms of water a few cable-lengths
from the shore.</p>

<p>The barquentine had come in with scarcely a sound, but
scarcely had she taken anchorage than Babel broke out
on board. The voice of Jules could be heard above the
others, ordering the boats to be got ready; stores were
being brought on deck, whilst Sagesse, silent beside Gaspard,
watched the preparations for landing with a brooding
eye, throwing in a command now and then.</p>

<p>The longboat and a quarterboat were lowered and laden
with stores and the diving apparatus; it was nearly an
hour before the business was complete and Sagesse and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
his companion, taking their places in the stern of the
longboat, found themselves free of <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>
and making for the shore.</p>

<p>They rowed to the southern beach.</p>

<p>“I will take the quarterboat across the island,” said
Sagesse. “It will be a bit of a job, but she’s light enough,
and eight of the hands will be able to do it. I’m going
to use her for the diving. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mordieu</i>, but it’s a desolate
place, this island of yours. There’s no gainsaying that.
Who would ever think there was a ship sunk here, and
lying in shallow water, too?”</p>

<p>“It’s lonely enough,” said Gaspard, his eyes fixed on
the white beach, the palms, and the grey-green stretch of
bay-cedar bushes. Now that he was close in shore, all the
elation of the treasure hunt had passed from him, giving
place to a feeling of melancholy. Oh, those palms, that
rag of tent fluttering in the wind, that scorching splash
of sunlight on the beach—what visions of desolation did
they not call up! The place seemed to him full of death
and tragedy, repellant, as though the shade of Simon
Serpente were walking in the sun-blaze of the beach, as
though the voices of the gulls were the voices of his men;
ghosts of old buccaneers condemned to eternal restlessness
and discontent.</p>

<p>But with the grounding of the boat’s nose on the sand
all this passed away. He flung himself over the side and
helped to run her up as far on the beach as the weight
of her cargo would let them pull her; the quarterboat
was beached just beside her, and then the unlading began.</p>

<p>Whilst it was still in progress Sagesse, leaving Jules
to superintend, took Gaspard’s arm.</p>

<p>“Come,” said he, “let’s have a look at her. The tide’s
half out and she ought to show up well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
“This way,” said Gaspard.</p>

<p>He led his companion amidst the bushes, avoiding the
spot where he knew, face down amidst the bay cedars,
the body of Yves was lying; he dared not even look twice
towards the place, and he breathed more freely when they
had passed it.</p>

<p>The line he took would also lead them twenty yards
or so to westward of the mound beside which Yves had
discovered the belt and pouch and the skeleton to which
they belonged.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were free of the bushes and on
the northern beach.</p>

<p>The tide was more than half out and the whole of the
encircling reef of the lagoon was visible. Gaspard led
the way on to the reef, then along it, till he reached the
spot opposite the foretop, weed-grown and projecting from
the water.</p>

<p>“Look,” said he, pointing into the lagoon.</p>

<p>Sagesse without a word, stared down at the vision beneath
him.</p>

<p>It was a part of the mystery of the sea that the lagoon
water changed in brilliancy and clarity with the tide; with
a flooding tide, and at full, its diamond brightness dimmed
almost imperceptibly and brightened almost imperceptibly
with the ebb. One would not have noticed the fact but
for the submerged ship and her crust of coral jewellery;
which shewed brighter or dimmer according to the clarity
of the water.</p>

<p>Possibly outside the lagoon the sea floor held some clay
that misted almost imperceptibly the incoming water—who
knows?—but the fact remained that at half-tide of the
ebb she was more brilliantly defined than at half-tide of
the full—as to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Gaspard, as he stood beside Sagesse, looking also, followed
with his eyes the fish-like form and the trend of
the bulked-out bulwarks. At the sight of her and the
thought of the diving apparatus and all the tackle for
salving, the treasure-fever was on him again, hot and
strong. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mordieu!</i> when she was broken open, what might
they not find?</p>

<p>He turned from her to Sagesse, expecting to read his
own eagerness in the Captain’s face, but the face of Sagesse
shewed nothing.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Gaspard, “what do you think of her?”</p>

<p>Sagesse did not seem to hear the remark; he seemed
plunged in thought.</p>

<p>Then he spat into the water and turned back along the
reef to the shore. Gaspard followed him.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of her?”</p>

<p>“What do I think? <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ma foi!</i> I think she was sunk at
her moorings.”</p>

<p>There was a note of gloom in his tone.</p>

<p>“You think she was not wrecked?”</p>

<p>“She’s lying on too even a keel; she’s lying by that
reef just as a ship would lie if scuttled at her moorings.”</p>

<p>“But, see here, if she was moored in that basin, she
must have entered it, and there is no opening to admit
a ship.”</p>

<p>“Not now—but eighty or so years ago there was likely
an opening, and that place was a kind of harbour. Serpente
would have used that harbour.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Gaspard, “why should he have scuttled
his ship?”</p>

<p>“Ah, why?—who knows? We know he was chased; we
know he had a cargo of slaves, and a crew each man of
whom was a witness against him. He may have kept a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
boat provisioned and moored to the ship’s side; then, at
night, with a confederate, battened the hatches, main and
fo’cs’le, scuttled her, and made for the American coast
in the boat—see?”</p>

<p>Sagesse seemed to have worked out the whole question
in his dark mind and seemed deeply dissatisfied with the
solution arrived at.</p>

<p>“But,” said Gaspard, “how about those bones we found,
that skull?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the skull! He may have been killed in turn, and
robbed of his treasure by his confederate,—who knows?
there are a hundred ways of making skulls in a job like
that. Only I say this: I lay a hundred to one, if he
scuttled his ship, he didn’t scuttle her with the money on
board.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s a hundred to one we will find nothing.”</p>

<p>“I said it was a hundred to one if he scuttled her the
money wasn’t on board. I don’t know whether he scuttled
her or not; I’m only supposing that he did it. No, the
chances are not so bad as that, but they aren’t as good as
I thought. But—”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I don’t smell money there. It may be stupidity, it
may be I don’t know what, but when there’s money in a
thing I seem to know it. I don’t seem to feel there is
money on that ship.”</p>

<p>They were returning not by the path through the bushes,
but by the eastern beach. From their left came the crying
of the gulls, from their right the cries and shouts of the
negroes unlading the last of the boat’s cargo.</p>

<p>The diving apparatus was already ashore, under shelter
of a sail stretched between two of the palms; the white
sand was strewn with packages and boxes. Sagesse, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
thought of everything, was going to run no risks; provisions
for three months for the shore party were being
landed, for there was always the chance of the vessel being
blown off the island and leaving the shore party
marooned.</p>

<p>Not only had stores to be landed, but a tent had to
be erected to protect them from the sun. This was now
being put up.</p>

<p>Two of the crew with cutlasses were slashing a path
through the bushes for the men who would have to carry
the boat to the lagoon.</p>

<p>As Gaspard and Sagesse watched the busy crowd, Sagesse
drew a cigar from his pocket and lit it. Gaspard
searched for his pipe in his pocket, found it and filled it;
but before he could strike a light a horrible thing
happened.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI<br />

<span class="subhead">THE SKULLS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One of the negroes, working amidst the bushes, gave a
cry, stooped, picked up something, and held it aloft. It
was a skull.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ma foi!</i>” said Sagesse, taking the arm of Gaspard and
leading him towards the spot where the negro stood with
the skull still raised in air. “Skeleton Island, as you
once called this place, does not seem amiss as a name.”</p>

<p>Gaspard, pale to the lips, did not answer. He advanced
alongside of Sagesse; he dared not draw back or
shew emotion, as the whole of the landing party were
trooping around to see what was amidst the bushes. Besides,
he had killed Yves accidentally, so he told himself.
Why should he falter at the sight of his bones?</p>

<p>But no logic could veil the horror of the thing. To see
before you the skull of a man to whom you have talked,
with whom you have worked side by side, with whom you
have jested, and to know that the skull is your handiwork,
your terrible <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chef-d’oeuvre</i>, that but for you it would
be clothed in flesh and filled with soul; that is the most
tragic sight on which the gaze of man can fall.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i>” said Sagesse, taking the thing from the
hands of the negro. “This must then be the skull of the
man who landed here with you and whom you left dead—what
was his name, do you say?”</p>

<p>“Yves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ah, oui</i>, Yves—” He stirred amidst the bushes with
his foot. “And here are Monsieur Yves’ bones. He has
soon become a skeleton, Monsieur Yves, but I have seen a
man become a skeleton in the tropics in a week. The
crabs, the larvae, the sun, all help in the work.” He
stooped down and picked up a tobacco-box and a seaman’s
belt with knife attached.</p>

<p>“Why, what is this? He had not drawn his knife!”</p>

<p>“He had drawn it,” said Gaspard, “but I picked it up
and put it back in its sheath.”</p>

<p>The onlookers knew nothing of the tragedy under these
words, or of the veiled accusation in the words of Sagesse;
but they noticed that Gaspard was shivering like a man
with ague.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sagesse, “we will keep the belt and knife
as mementoes of Monsieur Yves. Here, Jules, take them
back to the ship with you when you go, and get a spade
and dig a hole in the sand for these bones.”</p>

<p>He turned away, and the men resumed the work of
unlading and storing the provisions and gear. By eight
bells, noon, everything was completed; the quarterboat
was dragged up high on the beach and ready for carting
across the islet, and the hands knocked off for dinner.
Sagesse and Gaspard ate apart from the others, under
the shade of a sail that had been especially rigged for
them and would form their tent at night. The white sand
near the bushes shewed traces of having been turned over
with a spade where the bones of Yves had been buried.
Gaspard saw the place, but he did not mind—the treasure-fever
had cast everything else to a distance; things seemed
strange that were familiar; he had forgotten Sagesse’s
disheartening words; his imagination saw the sands covered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
with bags of dollars and bullion cases; he laughed as he
ate. But Sagesse did not laugh, scarcely spoke, and when
the meal was over, drew a cigar from his pocket and lit it.</p>

<p>He was sitting in the shadow of the canvas; the sands
and the blue sea lay before him. On the sand just before
the tent the palm-top shadows were beginning to crawl—it
was one o’clock.</p>

<p>As he sat like this, listening to the chanty of the negroes,
who were beginning to haul the boat across the island, of
a sudden he made an exclamation and struck his knee with
his hand.</p>

<p>An idea had evidently occurred to him. He called to
Gaspard, who had risen and was walking up and down
on the sand outside.</p>

<p>Gaspard approached.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, “what is it?”</p>

<p>“An idea,” said the Captain. “We have come here, but
we have not observed etiquette.”</p>

<p>“Ah, what do you say?” asked Gaspard, who had heard
the word in the course of his life, but did not know the
meaning.</p>

<p>“We have not called on the proprietor of the place.”</p>

<p>“The proprietor?”</p>

<p>“Simon Serpente.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I had forgotten.”</p>

<p>Sagesse rose to his feet and took Gaspard’s arm.</p>

<p>“Come,” said he, “let’s go and hunt for the gentleman’s
remains. It would be curious, at all events, to see them.
You know where you saw them last?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” replied Gaspard, leading the way across
the bushes.</p>

<p>The boat was being hauled along on rollers over a path<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
cut through the bushes, and the pulley-haul chanty of the
negroes crossed with the crying of the gulls:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">A Fort de France. Ay ho!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">A Fort de France. Ay ho!</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and from the gulls, wearily on the wind:</p>

<p class="center">“Yves—Yves—Yves!”</p>

<p>“It was near here,” said Gaspard.</p>

<p>They had come to the little rise in the ground amidst
the bushes, and sure enough his foot, taking its next step
forward, struck something hard and hollow.</p>

<p>He bent down and picked it up. It was the skull
which was unlike any other skull, either of man or beast.</p>

<p>Sagesse held the thing in his hand for a moment as he
glanced round him. At his feet, dimly through the
branches of the bay-cedar bushes, he could see the bones
of Serpente shining white, half revealed, half hidden.</p>

<p>Then, flinging the skull into the air and catching it
again, he burst into a fit of laughter. In a trice his depression
had vanished.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Mordieu!”</i> said Gaspard, “you seem pleased.”
“Perhaps. It is as if this thing had said to me, ‘You
are wrong. The treasure is on board the ship. Stretch out
your hand, my friend, and take it.’”</p>

<p>He cast the skull amidst the bushes and turned to superintend
the negroes hauling the boat to the northern beach.</p>

</div>

<p>That night, as they sat in the tent smoking, Gaspard approached
the object of his grievance.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said, “we have got the boat across the
island and afloat in the lagoon. We have got the diving
apparatus in her ready for working. Nothing remains to
be done but start work to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, before we start work, I have a word to say.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“It’s about the terms of our agreement.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I am to have fifteen francs out of every hundred francs
you make?”</p>

<p>“Those were the terms.”</p>

<p>“Well, it seems to me not enough.”</p>

<p>Sagesse gave a short laugh. “How, not enough?”</p>

<p>“Who discovered the ship?”</p>

<p>“Your friend, Yves—so you told me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but as a matter of fact, we both discovered it,
for if he had not done so I would have at the first low
tide I was over there.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on,” said Sagesse. “What are you driving
at?”</p>

<p>“I say fifteen per cent. is not enough. I want thirty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you want thirty, do you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You want Monsieur Yves’ share as well as your own?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“That seems to me not unjust,” said Sagesse in a meditative
tone.</p>

<p>“I would not ask you if it were unjust.”</p>

<p>“Yet, it seems to me,” said Sagesse, “that the conditions
accompanying Monsieur Yves’ death make a difference.
You killed this man, yet you wish to inherit his share.
How about his relations?”</p>

<p>“How about the relations of Pedro, whom you killed?”
asked Gaspard.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” replied Sagesse. “You have me there, it
seems; you have me in a corner, it seems. I have only
been twice before in my life held up by obstacles.
Now, do you not think it is a dangerous game
to play with me, cornering me like that?” Sagesse’s
voice had a complaining tone, as though they were talking
of some trifle.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Gaspard, with a smile, “I am armed.” He
tapped the pocket where the revolver was.</p>

<p>Sagesse’s face took on an expression of disgust, almost.</p>

<p>“Armed! Oh, you are only fit for the stokehold! Do
you take me for a knifer or a Chinese hatchet man?
Suppose I were to kill you to-night in your sleep, what
would happen? Every man on board who knew of it
would be my master. I don’t kill.”</p>

<p>He spoke the truth. Captain Sagesse, though he had
killed Pedro accidentally, was no murderer. His art was
quite beyond that rough method of settling disputes and
gaining money.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Gaspard, “kill or not kill, I am not afraid.
I am fighting for my rights.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
“And your rights you shall have.”</p>

<p>“You will give me the thirty per cent.?”</p>

<p>Sagesse nodded his head.</p>

<p>“Right,” said Gaspard, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>Sagesse took it.</p>

<p>“And now,” said he, “let us forget our differences and
have a drink.”</p>

<p>He brought out a case-bottle of rum from a corner of
the tent and two mugs. They drank together, pledging
each other, pledging Fortune, Serpente, the
whole world. Then Gaspard, when the carouse had lasted
some two hours, lay down on his blanket and tapped his
pipe out against his heel. But he could not sleep for a
long time, or if he slept, his dreams were so vivid as to
be almost real happenings.</p>

<p>Men passed before the tent entrance; they were carrying
parcels and packages as though the landing party were
returning to the ship. He heard Sagesse’s voice and the
voice of Jules; he heard laughter and then he heard no
more, for slumber had suddenly shut on him like the lid
of a box.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br />

<span class="subhead">THE AWAKENING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>He awoke not knowing in the least where he was; then
he remembered.</p>

<p>His tongue felt huge in his mouth and his hands seemed
the size of pillows. He had felt all this before once,
long ago, when a knock-out drop had been put in his
drink and he had been shanghaied. It was a frightful
sensation, for, added to it was the depression of the rum
and the knowledge that he had drunk to excess.</p>

<p>Ah! those nervous temperaments that liquor makes god-like
for a moment of illusion, how they suffer face to face
with their beastlikeness the morning after!</p>

<p>The wind was blowing—the faintest breath—through
the open door of the tent, and the sea lay beyond the
beach still and grey.</p>

<p>The sea that yesterday had been blue as sapphire had
lost its blueness and beauty and lay grey and still, breaking
on the beach in little ripples. The sky above the sea
was of a dull zinc colour, darker at the horizon than at
the zenith. Gaspard did not remember ever having seen
a tropic sky like that, so still in its greyness, so steadfast,
so gloomy.</p>

<p>Through the open door of the tent the wind carried
with it the faintest powdering of dust. It irritated his
eyes; he looked at his right hand—it was covered with
grey dust. This was not sand from the beach; this was
dust, volcanic dust, grey and dismal. Some volcano of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
the islands was in eruption, some volcano down Martinique
way, for the dust was blown from that direction by
the southeast trade wind.</p>

<p>But Gaspard knew nothing of volcanoes or their dust.
He lay listening for the voice of Sagesse. He had not
yet recognized that a drug had been used against him
the night before. He put everything down to the drink,
and felt ashamed to face his companion.</p>

<p>He lay listening. Not a sound except a slight pattering
and scratching of the palm fronds as now and then they
lifted to the faintest breath of air. Then what breeze
there was died utterly away, and complete silence held the
island, broken now and then by the far-off crying of the
gulls.</p>

<p>He struggled to his feet, cursing the rum he had drunk
the night before, and himself for having drunk it. Then
he came tottering out on to the beach. The first thing
that struck his eye was the empty space where last evening
the pile of stores had stood, covered with a sail-cloth. The
stores had not been completely removed; a bag of biscuits
and a case of canned meat had been left.</p>

<p>His gaze travelled from these to the shore edge, where
the longboat ought to have been had the working party
been ashore. It was not there. Then, flinging off his shoes
and working his way a couple of yards up the stem of a
palm, he sought the western anchorage.</p>

<p><i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> was gone.</p>

<p>He came down from the tree shaking and faint, the
perspiration running from the palms of his hands and his
lips dry as sandstone.</p>

<p>He was marooned. The thing was clear. Sagesse had
doctored him the night before with a knock-out drop;
he had been “doped,” and as he lay unconscious the evasion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
had been made. But why? The answer was easy enough
to find when one knew the character of Sagesse. To leave
Gaspard alone on his island, knowing what he had suffered
there before, would be a piece of revenge after
Sagesse’s heart; yet Gaspard felt this not to be the
solution.</p>

<p><em>Why</em> had Sagesse flown like this, leaving the ship of
coral in the lagoon untouched? Had he, then, sure knowledge
that the treasure was not there, and that time would
be wasted in looking for it? Trying to find an answer to
the riddle set him, and scarcely knowing where he went,
he took the path across the islet along which the quarterboat
had been drawn to the lagoon.</p>

<p>Even before he reached the northern beach two things
struck his eye; the quarterboat, with all the diving apparatus
on board, lay floating in the lagoon and moored to
the eastern edge of the basin; and far out at sea <i>La Belle
Arlésienne</i> with all sail set lay becalmed.</p>

<p>Out there on the desolate grey of the calm sea, her old
sails hanging flaccid and without a motion, <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>
had an inexpressibly lugubrious and sinister
appearance.</p>

<p>It was as though she had been caught in some wicked
act and, trying to escape, had been arrested. The calm
was holding her in a grip as powerful as the iron grip
of ice; the south equatorial current, broken here, would
not give her a drift of more than a mile an hour to the
north. She might hang in sight of the island for a day
or more.</p>

<p>Gaspard, standing on the reef, shook his fist at her
and cursed her, and her captain and crew. He remembered
the very first day he had seen her, and how, working
himself up into a nervous fever of imagination, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
had fancied her passing without seeing him and had cursed
her and her captain and her crew.</p>

<p>She had taken him from the island and had brought him
back; on board of her he had given himself away to
Sagesse under the influence of rum. She had brought
him to Martinique, she had given him Marie and the hope
of a happy future—and she had taken them away again.
She was an evil thing, and he cursed her again as he
stared across the sea, not noticing that through the air,
upon his clothes, upon the reef, upon the bay-cedar bushes
behind him, the almost impalpable grey dust was still
falling.</p>

<p>The wind had utterly ceased and a candle would have
burnt without a flicker in that motionless air. Gaspard
had no idea of the time of day, for the light came through
the clouded sky evenly diffused as light comes through a
scuttle of ground glass.</p>

<p>He turned his eyes from the distant vessel to the boat
floating on the lagoon.</p>

<p><em>Why</em> had Sagesse abandoned the boat and the valuable
diving apparatus? Sagesse of all men in the world, Sagesse,
who turned over a half-penny twice before he
parted with it! The boat and gear were worth a very considerable
sum, and here they were—thrown away.</p>

<p>He turned from the beach and began to re-cross the islet.</p>

<p>Halfway across, at the spot where yesterday he had
shewn Sagesse the skull of Serpente, he stopped dead,
flung up his arms, and cried out as though he had been
shot.</p>

<p>The little mound beside which Yves had found the bones
of Serpente and the pouch of gold was no longer there;
in its place there was a cavity about six feet long and four
wide and five deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
He saw it all at once in one blinding flash. Serpente’s
treasure had never been on board that ship. It had
been here safely cached, and Serpente had died and left
his bones beside it.</p>

<p>It was obvious now; the mound of earth, the ship sunk
in the lagoon, the bones bleaching beside the mound; yet
he had never seen a glimpse of it at all, whereas Sagesse,
at the first sight of the ship, had smelt the truth; Sagesse
at sight of the mound had known almost as a fact that the
treasure of Serpente lay there. He recalled how Sagesse
had laughed as he flung the skull away into the bushes; he
recalled how last night he had demanded thirty per cent. of
the findings, and how Sagesse had given in and agreed to
his demand. Then, while he, Gaspard, drugged and asleep,
lay snoring in his tent, Sagesse, with Jules perhaps to help
him, came here, dug, found what they sought, collected their
men, collected their stores, rowed to <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>,
up-anchored, and sailed away north for the American coast.</p>

<p>The blood rushed to Gaspard’s face as he thought of this,
Sagesse’s words, spoken in the café of the Rue Victor
Hugo, came back to him. “It is men like you who fill
stokeholds.” Yes, he belonged to the race of men who cannot
see, the inefficient men who fill stokeholds, the men
without worldly wisdom and insight, who do the work of
the world with their hands, while the sharpers and scoundrels
and business men take the profits.</p>

<p>He flung himself on his knees by the hole and looked
into it. At the bottom something caught his eye, and,
leaping down, he picked it up. It was a coin, heavy, battered,
and almost soot-black. He bit it, and the tiny dint
of the toothmark showed yellow. It was gold.</p>

<p>He dragged himself up amid the bushes, and with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
coin in his hand stood looking away at the sea, where <i>La
Belle Arlésienne</i> lay becalmed.</p>

<p>A wild idea occurred to him of trying to reach her with
the quarterboat that was lying in the lagoon. Impossible.
There were no oars, the heavy diving pump was fixed
on board her firmly, he had no tools to remove it with,
and even at high tide, when the sea edge of the reef was
submerged, he doubted if she could be got across it.</p>

<p>As he stood like this, the sea, which had been breaking
in tiny waves, the still grey sea that seemed asleep, suddenly
gave a deep sigh.</p>

<p>A glassy roller, stealthy as a thief, had stolen shoreward
from the north and broken upon the reef. Gaspard
turned his eyes from <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>, caught a glimpse
of something in the sky to westward, shaded his eyes and
looked.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XXXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX<br />

<span class="subhead">DISASTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A smoke-coloured band, curious, and like a thin curved
cloud, cut the grey background of sky to eastward. It
was in motion. Even as he looked it changed subtly in
shape till now it became a comet of smoke, head pointing
to the island.</p>

<p>Far away to the northeast, another band of smoke, grey
and also in motion, caught his eye.</p>

<p>There was something sinister in these apparitions so
strange to the eye, so perplexing to the mind, so dismal
in colour against the dismal grey of the sky.</p>

<p>What could they be?</p>

<p>The coin he held in his hand was forgotten; unconsciously
he put it in his pocket and, folding his arms,
looked.</p>

<p>Now the approaching comet of smoke altered again in
form, becoming a line definite, distinct, and swiftly approaching
like an apparition in a dream.</p>

<p>Ah! what was that—that voice mournful and complaining?
In a flash the meaning of the phenomenon was revealed.
They were birds. A vast flock of gulls, thousands,
beating the air as with one wing, crying aloud as with
one voice; then silent, always advancing.</p>

<p>And now the gulls of the island rose clamouring, like
a burst of smoke; in a moment the air was filled with
birds, in a moment the oncomers had joined the island<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
birds, in a moment, all rising as if by common consent, the
feathered thousands took definite form and encircled the
island in a vast moving ring.</p>

<p>The “hush” of their wings sounded like the continuous
beating of the sea on the shore.</p>

<p>Gaspard, with head upturned, gazing at the wonderful
sight, saw the second flight approaching. It joined the
others, circled with them, and then, just as if the moving
ring had been bent by a wind, it broke and in two vast
flocks the moving host passed away to westward, became
clouds again, and slowly vanished, leaving the island to
silence and desolation.</p>

<p>There was something tragic in this great migration of
birds and in the utter silence that followed their vanishing.
There was something disturbing in the absolute
peace which had taken the whole world into its keeping.</p>

<p>Close to Gaspard, caught in the branches of the bay-cedar
bushes, lay something white. As he turned his eyes
from the western horizon, whence the great flock had vanished,
his eyes caught this white thing, and he approached
it. It was the skull of Serpente, thrown away by Sagesse,
now grinning at the grey sky as though reading there some
frightful joke, some diabolical secret of Nature.</p>

<p>Gaspard turned his eyes from this thing to the distant
vessel, caught in its flight, arrested and held in bondage
by the calm. One might have fancied that the grinning
skull drew its mirth from the predicament of Sagesse.
To Gaspard it seemed that the skull was the centre from
which all that silence and desolation of sea and sky radiated,
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quid obscurum</i> at the heart of that peace which
was holding the world in its spell.</p>

<p>He turned to the southern beach and sought the tent.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
As he entered it and lay down to rest his aching head,
the sea again, moving uneasily, boomed on the reef to
northward and sighed on the sand of the southern beach.
The unrest, the unhappiness that lives in the heart of
things, seemed to speak in that voice.</p>

<p>He turned as he lay and cast himself face downwards
with arms outstretched. Tricked, betrayed, marooned,
robbed of the gold for which he had forgotten her, he
remembered now Marie. Sagesse, the treasure, <i>La Belle
Arlésienne</i>, all that trash vanished from his mind for a
moment before the vision of the thing he loved.</p>

<p>Had there been the slightest chance of outwitting Sagesse,
of regaining his hold upon the treasure, the fever
for revenge and gold would have held his mind from all
else; but he recognized that the game was lost, and in his
desolation he turned to his only thought of comfort. And
here again the game was lost. Love had tricked him just
as fortune had tricked him, and just as cruelly.</p>

<p>To find Marie again he must first find Martinique. Suppose,
even, that a ship were to rescue him; that ship might
be bound for any port in the world but Martinique. He
had no money, no trade. To gain enough to return to St.
Pierre he would have to go back to the stokehold, he
would have to work ships across and across the world before
his wretched pay, saved and scraped together, would
give him money sufficient to return with. He might write
to M. Seguin, but where in his wandering life would he
get the reply?</p>

<p>It might be months before a ship rescued him; it might
be months before that ship landed him at a port where he
could get work; it might be years before he reached Martinique—and
meanwhile, what of Marie? Ah! the want of
money, just a little of that money which the rich find so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
burdensome, that want is the curse of the poor, that want is
the essence of the true tragedy of life.</p>

<p>The hunger which poverty imposes on man is nothing to
the loneliness and the separation, the heart-break and the
starvation for want of love.</p>

<p>He loved Marie now, with the love that comes after
marriage, the love that has nothing to do with passion.
Across separation and disaster he saw her as she really
was, beautiful, single-hearted, loving, and faithful—and
he might never meet her again. To reach her he would
have to journey to all parts of the world, working as a
slave in a stokehold with that ache in his heart, earning
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sou</i> by <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sou</i>, the money that would bring him to her—and
every moment of separation seemed a year.</p>

<p>Stung suddenly to madness, with the tears upon his face,
he left the tent and sought the beach outside, walking up
and down it like a frenzied creature, cursing, calling out,
wild with the petty things that had him in their grip, the
little Fates that had bound him to this islet as the Lilliputians
bound Gulliver. He saw nothing of his own handiwork
in this fate which he cursed; he saw nothing of the
grave faults of mind, the weaknesses, the impetuosities
that had flawed his life, killing Yves, and binding him to
the will of Sagesse; he only saw his Fate and that it was
horrid—and he cursed it.</p>

<p>After awhile he paused. A wind had risen and was
blowing from the north across the islet. He recognised
that the day had grown suddenly darker and as he stood
wiping the sweat from his brow, confused, and exhausted
with the conflict of thought through which he had passed,
he heard a noise, faint, far away, and indeterminate. It
came from the north with the wind that was now increasing
in force. He glanced round at the sky. All the northern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
sky was dusky, like hot bronze; it had a solid look, and
even as he gazed some wind of the higher atmosphere set
to work compacting the upper part of this dark zone, ruling
it level in one infinite line. Added to the darkness of
the coming storm was the dusk of evening. The drug
must have held him in its spell much longer than he had
thought.</p>

<p>Next moment Gaspard was making across the islet to the
northern beach; when he reached it he stopped, shaded his
eyes with both hands, and looked.</p>

<p><i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> had got the wind at last. She
shewed as if sketched in grey chalk against the great black
wall that the coming storm had built across the world.
Heavens! what a sight was that wall! It seemed built by
plumb-line and square, titanic, immeasurable.</p>

<p>And from behind it came that sound, growing momently
more definite, as though all the hosts of darkness were
murmuring together, wild to break through some hidden
door and burst upon the world.</p>

<p>Against this prodigious menace <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> was
moving, steering N.N.East on the starboard tack. Sagesse
had taken in sail, but in the face of what was coming, not
enough, to a sailor’s eye. But no one knew better than
Sagesse that all to southward of him the sea was full of
death, in the form of rocks and shoals; to make an offing
was imperative.</p>

<p>Now the wind was coming in gusts, whipping the foam
over the reef, and the spray in the face of Gaspard, and
before the wind the league-long waves were racing shoreward.</p>

<p>As he looked, as he listened, the great wall seemed gradually
to bend from the top and over it came the rushing
wind, and with the wind the first note of thunder, profound,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
funereal, and dreamy; less like thunder than the
muffle of muffled drums.</p>

<p>At this moment the setting sun, pale like an appalled
spectator, glanced through the clouds, lit the sea, <i>La Belle
Arlésienne</i> and the advancing wall of storm. It was no
longer a wall; it had become concave, in the form of a
breaking wave, and the wave became veiled with mist, and
<i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> blotted out behind the roaring rain.</p>

<p>Dominating the thunder, the wind, the howling of the
storm, the voice of the rain tore the air as it washed over
the sea and then over the islet, wave-like and solid almost
as a wave. It cast Gaspard down like a great hand and
held him half drowned; it released him for half a second
and before he could struggle to his feet the wind hit him
and drove him like a rag amidst the bushes, and the sand
of the beach rushed over him, not as sand but slush, half
choking him. He thought the waves of the sea were upon
him, but there were now no waves on the sea, which was as
smooth beneath the wind as a new planed board, and as
white as driven snow.</p>

<p>On his face, now, struggling to rise, he could not; it
was as though a great sheet of iron held him down, and
with the first real crash of thunder, prone on his face, he
felt the earth splitting under him and shouted to the mud
beneath him, “The world is gone—the world is gone!”
But the world held fast though now, blow after blow, the
gods seemed smashing at it with mighty hammers, sickening
concussions, jets of light, deafness, blackness, misery,
and the iron hand of the wind, all had fallen upon the
world, rending thought to pieces. It could have lasted but
a minute, this first desperate onslaught of the hurricane,
yet to Gaspard it seemed that time had been torn away by
the wind, that he had known eternity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Now, released partly from the grip of that hateful hand
which had pressed him nearly to death, he struggled to his
knees and crawled further amidst the bushes where they
were thickest; here there was shelter of a sort, the bushes
low-growing and firm-rooted made a bulwark against the
wind and the spindrift rushing across the island like blown
white sheets. Again and again the yelling blackness would
be lit by the lightning and the whirling spirals and blankets
of spray above shown up only to vanish in the roaring
darkness where the world seemed fighting for its life with
chaos.</p>

<p>Then came stupor; like a man half under the influence of
chloroform the man amidst the bushes, deafened, and
blinded and stupefied by the torment around him, saw
visions, and dreamt dreams in which the blinding lightning
flashes lit blue seas and the voice of the wind was the voices
of people.</p>

<p>How long he lay like this it would be impossible to say
before raising himself on his elbow, he returned fully to
consciousness.</p>

<p>The great fury of the hurricane had passed; it was still
blowing hard and strong, but the worst was over and the
moon was lighting the world through the rushing clouds.
He rose to his feet, but fell on his knees again immediately.
He had eaten nothing during the past twenty-four hours,
and the drug was still weakening him; but in the moment
of rising he had seen a sight surpassing in terror even the
fury of the hurricane, and now amidst the bushes, on hands
and knees, motionless and petrified by the drama before
him, he looked.</p>

<p><i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> was coming ashore, now uplifted on
the crest of a wave, now vanishing in a hollow, dismasted
all but for the stump of the foremast, from which a rag of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
canvas was wildly flying. <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> was being
driven to the lagoon by the merciless whip of the wind.</p>

<p>The hag of the sea had found her master at last; stealth
and cunning could not save her now, nor trickery, nor subterfuge.
She had flung them all away. Like some witch
who had worked evil long in silence, dragged at last shrieking
to the gallows, the old barquentine seemed fighting
against her fate.</p>

<p>Her fluttering rags of canvas seemed clawing at the wind;
she screamed, and Gaspard on his knees could hear her
screams in the high-pitched wailing of her crew, the shrill
pig-like screaming of negroes hurled and huddled together,
animals waiting for inevitable death.</p>

<p>A moment he saw her held up strong in the moonlight
on the crest of a vast wave; then a cloud drew a skirt of
shadow over her and when the moon broke through again
she was gone, deep in the pocket of the lagoon, over which
the thirty-foot waves were rushing shoreward.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE PASSING OF SAGESSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>He must have fallen asleep as he knelt, for when he regained
consciousness he had no memory of having lain
down. Yet he was lying on his side amidst the bushes, the
day was broad, the sun shining, the sky without a cloud,
though still swept by the rushing wind.</p>

<p>He remembered all that had passed clearly and distinctly
and the miracle of that blue sky above him, after the black
and howling chaos of the night, filled his heart with thankfulness
untold.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet. His clothes were stiff with sea-salt,
his eyes half-blinded by the light. Then he cried out
in astonishment. The island, under the sun, and surrounded
by the racing amethyst of the sea, lay glittering white
as frost. It was sea-salt from the spray of the night before.
The palm trees were no longer there. There was nothing to
be seen but the winter-white bushes beneath the burning
sun. Bodies were washing ashore on the beach close to
him, but he scarcely glanced at them, the desolation before
him held him motionless and the knowledge that everything
was blown away, provisions, tent, everything!</p>

<p>He crossed to the southern beach. There lay the palms,
snapped off and dashed into the sand; a little mound just
by the sea edge drew him towards it; it was the case of
provisions. Hurled along by the wind, it had struck a
lump of coral and been sanded over; it had been shaken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
almost to pieces and a few blows with his heel burst the
staves apart. It was packed with tins of American preserved
meat, such as are exported especially to the West
Indies. He haggled a tin open with his knife and set to
on its contents. As he ate he saw something tangled in the
fronds of one of the broken palms. He came to it, kicked
the sand aside and found the bag of biscuit. Things were
not, then, so bad; but his mind was so dazed and benumbed
that he scarcely felt satisfaction at the sight of the food
and the knowledge that for a time, at least, he was saved
from starvation. He stood chewing the meat and gazing
about him, as an animal might gaze on finding itself in a
strange place.</p>

<p>Ever since his first landing upon it with Yves, the island
had seemed possessed of some diabolical presence. Yet on
looking back, there was nothing to be perceived but just an
ordinary and logical chain of events. With the exception
of finding the gold and the coral ship in the lagoon, all the
events, even the killing of Yves, came within the province
of ordinary sequence. Yet how sinister were they, taken
as a whole, from the first glimpse of the ship in the water
to the last glimpse of <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> hurled to her
death by the waves.</p>

<p>He was thinking nothing of this as he stood chewing the
food and gazing about him. The satisfaction of his hunger
was all that troubled him for the moment; then he sought
the little spring amidst the bushes, and drank.</p>

<p>He had not eaten for more than twenty-four hours, and
now the food he had taken made him feel drowsy, heavy
with weariness. He came to the blown-down palms, made
what shelter he could from the sun with their fronds, lay
down beside them and fell asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke some hours later, his mind was clear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
and his first thought was of Sagesse. So strange a thing
is the human mind that here, cast away, marooned on this
desolate spot without a tent to shelter him or a soul to
share his loneliness, his first sensation on fully regaining
his faculties was one of triumph. Sagesse had gone under,
that hateful mind, perfidious and dark, would trouble him no
more. He was revenged. He rose to his feet and shook
the sand from his clothes. The wind was still blowing
strong, but the sea had fallen. The gulls had not returned,
and the only sounds in all that blue and breezy world were
the sounds of the wind and the breaking waves. The frost-white
glitter of the bay-cedar bushes lent an extra touch
of brilliancy to the scene. Never had he seen the island
like this, sea-dashed and wind-blown, surrounded with tumultuous
life.</p>

<p>He crossed over to the northern beach. He wished to see
what he could of the wreck, but even before he was half
way across he could see that nothing remained of <i>La Belle
Arlésienne</i> but a few spars washing about in the lagoon
water, where ship of wood and ship of coral lay locked together
in ruin.</p>

<p>But things were washing ashore on the full tide—black
things to make one shudder, forms with limbs outspread,
looking like enormous jet-black starfish, forms locked together
in a deadly embrace as though they had gone to
their death fighting.</p>

<p>Then as Gaspard stepped from the bushes he saw with a
thrill of horror that the sands were in motion. Thousands
upon thousands of little crabs were congregating to the
feast; he trod on them as he walked, and amidst them, like
moving rocks, giant crabs from the eastern beach were
advancing like captains of this army of destruction.</p>

<p>He would have fled the hateful place had he not noticed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
a form that the sea had cast up almost free of the waves.</p>

<p>It was the body of Sagesse.</p>

<p>The man of wisdom and resource lay on his side, huddled
up as if asleep. He was fully dressed. Horrible
though the place was and dreadful with death, not all the
horror in the world could have prevented Gaspard from
advancing towards the body of Sagesse. It drew him
towards it against his will, as if by some mesmeric influence.</p>

<p>The right hand of the Captain lying across his chest had
upon one of the fingers something that glittered in the sun
like a star. It was a diamond, enormous and lovely with
light, set in an old-fashioned ring. It would have graced
the crown of an emperor; it would have held Gaspard
fascinated had not another object held him breathless.
From the muffler around the neck of Sagesse protruded the
head of a snake. Two bright red burning eyes flashed in
the sun, the thing seemed furious at being disturbed; a
moment more and one would have expected it to wriggle
from its concealment and strike, but Gaspard feared it
less even than he had feared the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i> of the Place
du Fort. He knelt down beside Sagesse, heedless of the
crabs now surrounding him, removed the muffler from his
neck and then removed the snake. It was of solid gold,
flexible, one of those antique bracelets made to wind round
and cling to a woman’s arm. The flat portion of the head
was formed by a quadrille of flat sapphires, the eyes were
pigeon-blood rubies. Leaving the extraordinary beauty
of the workmanship aside, the stones alone were worth a
little fortune.</p>

<p>Then Gaspard knew that the captain had indeed found
the treasure of Simon Serpente, and, seeing shipwreck before
him, had sorted out the most valuable things in a wild
attempt to save them with his own wretched life. With the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
sweat breaking out on his forehead at the possibilities
before him, he flung the serpent of gold on the ground
before searching the body. It fell on the swarming crabs.
He picked it up and flung it round his own neck. Then he
noticed that his hand was bleeding; it had been nipped by
one of the vermin which were now crawling up on the body
of Sagesse, as the Lilliputians swarmed on Gulliver. Seized
with fury, he sprang to his feet and kicked the brutes hither
and thither, stamped on them, crushed them. He might
as well have stamped on water advancing from an overflowing
dam; the clicking and rustling hordes swarmed on.</p>

<p>He flung himself on his knees again beside the body,
seized the hand with the ring, drew the jewel off and put
it in his pocket. He scarcely noticed that a crab was clinging
to the hand as he flung it aside. The left coat pocket
of Sagesse was bulging. He thrust his hand in and drew
out a knotted handkerchief; it chinked like a bag of marbles,
and from a corner a piece of broken gold fell out. It
was part of a brooch. He did not stay to investigate further;
the handkerchief held treasure. He thrust it into his
pocket and went on. There was a pocket-book in the
breast pocket of the coat, in the other pockets nothing of
value. He opened the waistcoat; he tore open the shirt;
nothing more. Wiping the sweat from his brow, he was
about to rise to his feet when he remembered that he had
not examined the left hand for rings.</p>

<p>He pushed the body over.</p>

<p>The left hand of Sagesse was closed tight on something.
The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">rigor mortis</i> was just passing, and Gaspard had no
difficulty in unlocking the fingers from the treasure they
contained. It was a pearl, a lovely milk-white pearl, large
almost as a pigeon’s egg. Why he had clung to this thing
especially, whether from superstition or not, who can say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Or was it a pearl not belonging to Serpente’s treasure at
all? A pearl of the lagoon that by some extraordinary
chance the drowning man had seized upon unknowingly in
his struggles? One might almost have imagined this to be
the case, for this thing was virginal as the sea and had
evidently never been set or worn by mortal.</p>

<p>Who can say? But so the captain of <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i>
had gone to his Maker, clasping this emblem of purity in
his hand, almost a parable on the mighty truth that each
one of us, however evil, has yet, in his soul, somewhere, a
priceless pearl.</p>

<p>Thoughts that never occurred to Gaspard.</p>

<p>He had risen to his feet. In his pockets lay the plunder
he had taken from Sagesse, in his hand the pearl,
around his feet the crabs swarming to their prey.</p>

<p>He was rich.</p>

<p>The sea had given him the riches that other men toil
their lives for, given it to him in one great glittering handful.
He seemed standing before a blinding light. It
seemed unthinkable that he who had striven all his life for
a pittance, working now as a sailor before the mast, now as
a slave in the blind alley of the stokehold, it seemed unthinkable
that he should have drawn this tremendous and
glittering prize.</p>

<p>As he stood in the blazing sunshine, the wind blowing
his hair about his eyes, his eyes staring, astonished, fixed,
as though he were gazing at Fortune herself, a black
shadow passed over him. It was the shadow of a cormorant.</p>

<p>Away out across the waves other birds were coming to
the feast; the wreck and the stranded corpses had been
signalled for miles across the sea, for the sea, like the
desert, has a watch-tower—the air, and a watchman who
never leaves that tower—eternal Hunger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
The bird cried as it wheeled and the cry brought Gaspard
to his senses. He glanced up, then down at the
swarming beach; then, touching his pocket to make sure
that the contents were safe, he turned from the horrors
around him and made towards the southern beach, running.</p>

<p>He wished to be alone with his treasure. He shouted
like a boy as he ran, taking the road through the bushes
that Serpente’s sailors had cut for the boat. The jewelled
snake round his throat glittered and flashed; never was
there a more extraordinary picture than this man, half
ragged, his clothes stained with sea-salt, his hair blowing
on the wind, the jewelled serpent around his neck, running
and shouting as he ran to the desolation around him,
and with Fortune.</p>

<p>At the place where the palm trees lay prone on the
sand he stopped, sat down, took the serpent of gold from
around his throat and placed it on the sand beside him, and
beside it the parcel.</p>

<p>Then from his pocket he took the knotted handkerchief
and the ring. He placed the ring by the pearl and then he
unknotted the handkerchief and poured the contents on the
white sand between his legs.</p>

<span class="subhead">TREASURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Broken bits of gold like the twigs from which jewelled
fruit had been torn, spinels, peridots, star sapphires, slab-shaped
emeralds, cinnamon stones, a black pearl shaped
like a pear, diamonds, an enormous turquoise <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de la vieille
roche</i> sun-stricken, coloured, flashing, the treasure of Simon
Serpente lay before Gaspard, other treasure there doubtless
had been in coin and gold, but this was the cream of
it, skimmed by Sagesse, selected no doubt during that calm
behind which the sailor’s eye had seen the approaching
hurricane.</p>

<p>Loot from the towns of Spanish South America, from
ships plundered and scuttled, from women and from altars,
all lay here in a confusion of colours. Some of these stones
absolutely shouted of sacrilege, huge, and splendid, never
could they have been worn as jewellery, except by emperors
or by jewelled saints in the twilit and incense-laden air
of some cathedral. Gaspard knew little of precious stones,
but a child or a savage would have guessed the worth of
this amazing collection of gems. For a moment after he
had turned them out of the handkerchief, his breath came
in gasps like the breath of a person dashed with cold water.
He could not touch them for a moment, it was as though he
were afraid of shattering an illusion. Then came the
thought:</p>

<p>They are mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
He curled his fingers, his lips drew back from his teeth,
then he laughed.</p>

<p>They are mine.</p>

<p>He banged his right hand, palm down on the sand beside
him, then he clapped his knees with both hands, then,
stretching out his hand he seized a wine-coloured amethyst.
It was the least valuable stone of the lot, but it was lovely
and it lay in his palm like a little lake of colour. He felt
its smoothness, turned it about, touched it with his tongue
as if he wanted to taste its beauty as well as feel and see it.</p>

<p>It was his, all these things were his and as the thought
came back to him he sprang to his feet and with the amethyst
in his left hand and his right hand shading his eyes,
he looked wildly around him.</p>

<p>Yes, he was alone, no one was watching him; no one was
there to dispute his possession; the wind blew and the bay-cedar
bushes bent before the wind, the sun shone, the sea
burned blue and flashed beneath the sun. In all the island
world there was no sign or sound of life save the flickering
wings of the cormorants on the northern beach and occasionally
their cries.</p>

<p>Loneliness no longer had terrors for him, the sight of a
ship at this moment would have flung him into consternation.
He, the man who had flung himself face downward
in the tent weeping at the thought that it might be months
before a ship sighted the island and took him off to begin
his long journey back to Martinique and Marie, would, had
he sighted a sail at this moment, have cursed it.</p>

<p>With the knowledge of possession had come the fear of
dispossession. He had not forgotten Marie, he had not
foregone his desire to return to Martinique, but in the first
wonderful hours with his treasure, he wished to be alone, to
feel it live under his hand, to make plans as to safe disposal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
to dream for a while the wonderful dream of wealth
here, where there was nothing to disturb him but the gulls
and the waves.</p>

<p>Besides, why should he grieve about Marie now? There
was nothing to stop him from reaching her, the road was
clear before him once he was free from the island, the least
of those stones lying there in a glittering heap would give
him his passage to Martinique from the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>He looked around at the far horizon—not a sail.</p>

<p>As he was standing thus with his hand in his left-hand
pocket containing the pocket-book of Sagesse which he had
not yet examined, he felt something beside the pocket-book.
A round, hard disc. It was the coin he had picked out of
the treasure pit. Rich as he was, this was the only coin in
his possession. Then, sitting down on the sand beside his
treasure, he began to sort the stones, arranging them in
lines according to their colour. Some were unset, others
had still clinging to them some fragments of the settings
from which they had been broken.</p>

<p>There were seven rubies, all of the true pigeon-blood
colour, the least of these was as large as one’s little finger-nail,
the three largest were immense stones as big as the
top of an ordinary man’s thumb above a line drawn across
the base of the nail; it is only in rubies of the true colour
and of this great size that the splendour of precious stones
finds its ultimate expression. There is nothing in the inanimate
world to approach them in magnificence and beauty.</p>

<p>There were seventeen emeralds, ten quite small and inconsiderable,
and seven simply priceless, all save the largest,
which was starred and flawed.</p>

<p>He arranged these beneath the rows of rubies. Then
came the diamonds of which there were forty-eight, not
counting the diamond in the ring lying where he had placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
it by the jewelled snake. Some of these diamonds still had
the gold of their settings clinging to them, the six largest
were the size of hazel nuts and of perfect water. In any
market of the world those six diamonds would have fetched
thirty thousand pounds and have given a huge profit to
the buyer, seven were about half the size of hazel nuts, but
of these one was blue and it alone was a little fortune; of
the thirty-five remaining three were sherry-coloured and the
remainder pure white.</p>

<p>The great turquoise had no companion, he placed it
alone on the sand beneath the diamonds, and then, under it,
he began to arrange the sapphires; as he was doing it a
shadow passed over him, it was the shadow of a frigate
bird, flying heavily, gorged with its feast and making south;
the same wind on which it was drifting brought with it
the clamouring of the cormorants; he rose, glanced around
and with dazed eyes looked over the sea, sweeping the horizon;
there was no sign of smoke or sail and he sat down
again to continue the jewelled pattern on the sand.</p>

<p>He counted the sapphires, two dozen and four there were,
varying from cornflower blue to the blue of night, varying
in size from the size of a pea to the size of a broad bean.
He arranged them between the turquoise. The great
amethyst he placed beneath the sapphires, and under the
amethyst the spinels, and peridots, of which there were
half a handful. The pear-shaped black pearl, the only
pearl amidst all these treasures, he placed last.</p>

<p>The white pearl, the ring, and the snake were still lying
apart by themselves; besides the stones arranged in lines
there were a few fragments of gold, bits of settings, which
he disregarded.</p>

<p>Then he sat and contemplated the glittering battalions
of his treasure. White, red, blue, the blue of the turquoise,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
the wine colour of the amethyst, the black of the pearl, he
feasted his eyes on them all. Then, turning on his back,
shutting his eyes and casting his right hand backwards
across them, he laughed.</p>

<p>He could see them almost better with his eyes shut.
That was the most delightful and extraordinary moment in
his life, it would have been in any man’s life; coloured
Fortune, real, tangible Fortune, Fortune in her most beautiful
guise at his elbow and the whole blue world before him;
what he would do with it all he did not dream; great
houses of the wealthy people, snow-white yachts that he
had seen in the various parts of the world, the vision of
the saloon of the <i>Rhone</i> laid out with cut glass and flowers
arose before him for a moment; all that belonged to the
world of the wealthy, all that world was his now, but he
built no imaginary palaces yet, just for the moment the
sensation of possession was all powerful, he wanted nothing
else.</p>

<p>Marie was fully alive and in the background of his mind,
and the knowledge that his wealth would enable him to
reach her was there and formed part of his satisfaction; but
he saw nothing truly yet but the great, blinding light that
Fortune was flashing in his eyes.</p>

<p>As he lay, the wash of the waves on the desolate beach,
the blowing of the wind across the bay-cedar bushes, the
crying of the frigate birds and cormorants came to him
like sounds heard in a dream.</p>

<p>Then the crying of the birds led his thoughts back to
Yves and Yves led him back to the stokehold. He could
hear the roar of the furnaces and the boom of the sea, the
clatter of the ash lift, the clash of the furnace doors. The
vision of Fortune had driven all that from his mind. In the
last couple of hours, he had passed through an amazing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
development; all the nobility and pride in his nature had
been quickened into life, latent powers until now unsuspected
were awakening in his being, wealth, and the power
of wealth were at his disposal. He felt like some exiled
king who had at last come to his own, and then, lo and
behold, like some horrible poor relation into his dream
stepped the stoker of the <i>Rhone</i>. Gaspard Cadillac, the
Moco, came to spoil the dreams of Gaspard Cadillac, the
wealthy man. Wealth, that thing for which we all crave,
had been in his possession scarcely an hour when it hit him
a blow.</p>

<p>“Hi, there, you dog of a Moco, hurry your stumps, down
to your furnace, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vite!—vite!—vite!</i>”</p>

<p>Those words had been shot at him by Cuillard, the chief
engineer of the <i>Rhone</i> as he had come aboard across the
Messagerie wharf at Marseilles before starting. They
were nothing to a stoker, but the remembrance of them was
bitter now, flame-like hatred against Cuillard shot up in
his breast, till he remembered that Cuillard was silent forever
out there where the <i>Rhone</i> was lying by the reef to
southward. But that thought gave him no relief against
the past that Cuillard’s words had evoked. That wretched
past! No present wealth could atone for all those years of
his life and their slavery. Yet only a few hours ago that
past had seemed not amiss!</p>

<p>Truly the lamp of fortune lights many things besides
happiness.</p>

<p>He sat up and looked at his hands. They were the hands
of a stoker and nothing on earth would make them anything
else. He was not ashamed of them, he was not thinking
that in the future those hands would proclaim him what
he was. No, but he was thinking of the black years those
hands had done slave’s work whilst here was lying the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
wealth that would have raised him to a high position in
the world. Ah! could he have bought those fifteen years
back, he would at that moment have given half of the glittering
stones to Time, utterly forgetting that in that bargain
he would have lost a white pearl beyond all earthly
jewels—Marie.</p>

<p>The wind had been falling and now was little more than
a steady breeze, afternoon was upon the island and the
sea was falling with the ebbing tide. He gathered his
fortune together into the handkerchief that had contained
it, then he placed this for extra security into his own handkerchief.
He knotted the corners tightly and then placed
the little bundle by the stem of the palm tree nearest him;
he placed the snake of gold beside the bundle, the ring on
his finger, and the great white pearl in his right-hand
pocket.</p>

<p>Then he remembered Sagesse’s pocket-book. He took it
out and opened it. It contained only papers all wet with
sea water and a note on the Bank of France for five hundred
francs. He placed the note on the sand with a piece
of coral on it to prevent the wind from blowing it away.
The sun would dry it. Then he tried to examine the papers,
they seemed of no use or importance to him, some
were letters with the ink all blurred by the sea water, there
were insurance certificates, an old theatre bill of a play
performed years ago at a New York theatre, and in one
packet a photograph with, on the back, the photographer’s
name.</p>

<p>Nadan, Photographer. Rue Royale, Nimes.</p>

<p>It was the photograph of a woman, an old peasant
woman to judge by the face and cap. Could it have been
the man’s mother? as likely as not. And he had prized it
evidently or he would not have given it a place in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
pocket-book. Why had he kept the theatre bill? Of what
romance or villainy was it the reminiscence, of what woman
betrayed or man defrauded did he keep it as a memento to
be read by Gaspard here, where to the crying of the cormorants,
the past of man seemed a game futile and filled
with derision. A play of shadows—tricking shadows.</p>

<p>He put the photograph and the theatre bill back in the
pocket-book, and the papers; then he made a hole in the
sand and buried it. To destroy the past of Sagesse utterly
was the greatest act that Gaspard could have performed
for humanity, failing that, to bury the records of it was a
commendable deed.</p>

<p>He had a flint and steel and the tobacco in his own tobacco
box had almost escaped wetting in the drenching of
the night before. He filled his pipe and lit it, he had not
smoked that day nor the day before and the tobacco, now,
had a doubly soothing action on his mind, it chased away
the stokehold and his recollections of the past, he forgave
Sagesse his villainies, it brought the image of Marie from
away across all those miles of ocean, he saw again the early
morning market on the Place du Fort. Pierre-Alphonse,
M. Seguin, and all the gay crowd beneath the blue sky
and the dark green tamarinds.</p>

<p>He would find out Pierre-Alphonse when he returned and
buy him a boat of his own, he would set Marie’s father up
again in business at Morne Rouge, he would give money to
all those people whom Sagesse had defrauded, he would
make St. Pierre happy. That good town where the people
had been so good to him. Then he would return to Montpellier,
at least for a time, and take Marie with him, they
would travel first class in the mail boat. He would go
down to the stokehold as passengers sometimes did, ah! the
stokers on that ship would have a good time when they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
reached Marseilles. He would go to the Riga tavern and
call for a chopin of wine and see Anisette serve it. Ah, Yves,
poor Yves, what a pity that he could not take the great,
burly Breton by the hand and give him a fist full of money—so
he lay smoking, playing with coloured shadows, spending
phantom gold, whilst the voices of the cormorants half
unheard, came on the wind across the bay-cedar bushes and
the voices of the waves answered them like eternity making
answer to time.</p>

<p>Then came the thought, “All that is very well, but how
are you to turn your fortune into gold?”</p>

<p>This had not occurred to him before, and at first it seemed
a simple matter, just a detail, then he remembered
Sagesse’s words about governments who were apt to interfere
in cases of treasure, men who sprang from nowhere
with fictitious claims. Sagesse was afraid of these things
and Sagesse was a clever man with thirty years of experience
behind him.</p>

<p>To go to a jeweller with those things would be to admit
at once the whole secret; to go to a pawn shop with the
smallest of those gems would bring on his head enquiries
that might prove fatal.</p>

<p>Here was a question to perplex a stoker’s mind. His
strong hands could fight to protect his treasure, but of
what avail was it to protect a useless thing?</p>

<p>He had read the romance of Monte Christo, few French
sailors have not, the immortal story that has become part of
the history of the world was recalled by him here, lost and
alone on the desolate islet of whose existence the great
Dumas had never dreamed.</p>

<p>But it gave him little help. He had lived his life in a
more sordid prison than that which held Edmund Dantès
for fourteen years. That black cell of the Château d’If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
had been illuminated by the mind of Faria; the profound
intelligence of the Abbé had given the future count not
only his treasure, but the genius and the worldly knowledge
which enabled him to dispose of it and turn it to
account. Gaspard had no such teaching to guide him. The
more he thought of the matter the more did his perplexity
increase. The world of a sudden seemed to him peopled
with robbers, antagonists, men who would take from him
by fraud, or law, the thing which was at once his dream
and his possession.</p>

<p>The curse of the imaginative mind came on him with
full force, the faculty that had once caused a ghost to
haunt him on the islet now filled the world with living
people and each person an enemy. He pictured men
whom he had never seen, not men of his own class, but
men dressed as well-to-do citizens, merchants, and so
forth, all sworn enemies to him and eager for his treasure.
He had once been in a law court, called as a witness in
a shipping disaster case; he saw that court now, and the
three judges, he was standing before them and they were
questioning him.</p>

<p>“Well, where did you get these things? Come, now,
they are not yours; you do not find these things in a
stokehold.”</p>

<p>He sweated at the thought.</p>

<p>Sagesse had spoken of taking the stuff to America; he
knew nothing of America. Martinique was the only place
he could take it to, the only place he wanted to reach,
and, at once, the remembrance of Martinique brought up
the image of M. Seguin. Ah! That was the solution.
M. Seguin would help him. He had all the worldly
knowledge necessary.</p>

<p>For a moment he was satisfied with this way out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
difficulty, and he began to doubt—not to doubt, exactly,
but to hold up M. Seguin’s image before his mind’s eyes
and to question it. “You are a reliable man, I know that,
for you are universally respected in St. Pierre; but this
treasure—look you, it is enormous, and remember, it is
all mine; I don’t want to give anyone half shares; I
just want some one to turn it into money, letting them
take a good profit on the transaction, certainly, but not
letting them rob me; would you do this for me? Could
I trust you?”</p>

<p>The mental image of M. Seguin, after the fashion of
images, made no reply. That hatful of gems, those blazing
diamonds, furious rubies, saint-tempting sapphires, all
that coloured temptation, who was there in the world that
might not yield to it? Only one person that he knew—surely—Marie.</p>

<p>Ah! Could she have peddled them with her other
wares, how gladly he would have cast them into her lap
without count or toll, but she of all people in the world
was most useless for his purpose.</p>

<p>He rose and paced the sands with Fortune, like the Old
Man of the Sea, on his back; even in his walk up and
down the desolate beach he was tethered by his treasure,
for he dared not go far from that magnetic bundle lying
by the palm bole; it was absurd to feel uneasy, he knew
that; there was no person here to steal it; all the same, it
held him close to it.</p>

<p>Now the sun, which had been steadily sinking, touched
the western edge of the sea and spilled his glory upon
the water, the blue and windy day died and passed at
a stroke to the momentary evening of the tropics, and the
evening into night.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MORNING SEA</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In a moment, night, wearing all her jewellery, was standing
above the sea, the wind had died away, the cormorants
had ceased crying, and the boom of the waves was the
only sound beneath the stillness of the stars.</p>

<p>Gaspard turned to his provision store for supper. He
had placed the canned meat and the biscuits close to one
of the tree boles, and to-morrow he would have to make a
caçhe to protect them from the sun. Thinking of this,
he ate his supper without appetite or knowing what he
ate; his mind had passed into that dazed condition which
comes from surfeit of sensation; it had fed full of treasure
and now was torpid.</p>

<p>When he had supped, he lit a pipe, but scarcely had he
done so than sleep came upon him, the pipe fell from
his mouth beside him as he lay there on the sands, the
stars shining upon him and the sea singing to him; marooned,
ragged, without a roof to shelter him, and with
the wealth of emperors at his elbow.</p>

<p>Hours passed and the great moving dome of the stars
shifted above the world; one might have thought the figure
on the sand a corpse cast up by the sea from some wreck.
Then it began to move and struggle and cry out; one might
have fancied it attacked by some unseen enemy. It was.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the deep unconsciousness of the first sleep
lifted, admitting the mind into dreamland, than Gaspard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
found himself surrounded by his enemies. He was passing
through horrible back streets and men were following him
to rob him. Yves, Sagesse, and the chief engineer of the
<i>Rhone</i> were amongst them.</p>

<p>Then the dream changed and he was standing in a bar
with Yves, showing him the treasure, and, behold, the
rubies and diamonds had changed to pieces of glass and
the rest to sea shells and rubbish—he had not even the
price of a drink and he had brought Yves in to stand
him a bottle of wine, brought him in arm in arm, boasting
of his wealth!</p>

<p>Then he was coming on board at the docks of Marseilles,
joining the ship with the treasure in his pocket, the beautiful
spirit of unreasonableness who presides over the affairs
of Dreamland did not hint to him of the absurdity
of the situation, his obfuscated reasoning faculty was engaged
in trying to solve the problem before him—the problem
of how to hide a million’s worth of gems and act as
stoker on a transatlantic steamer at the same time. To
increase the difficulty he had placed the snake of gold
under the muffler he wore round his neck—but it refused
to be hidden; and then, all at once, he was back again
in the docks in a tavern, fighting in a corner with his back
to the wall, whilst Malays from the P. &amp; O. boats, Dagoes
armed with sheath knives and a Chinaman—a hatchet man
such as he had heard tell of amidst the stokers—attacked
him for his treasure. He awoke gasping and still fighting
his viewless enemies. After a while he fell asleep again,
only to continue his experiences in Dreamland, awaking
finally, just as the sun’s rim was rising above the sea.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing now from E.S.E., and the sea
had lost its waves and had fallen back into quietude and
long lapses of swell—the gulls were back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Not the cormorants and frigate birds of the northern
beach, but the fishing gulls, the familiar spirits of the
island, whose voices had once terrified Gaspard. They
had returned during the night, but they did not terrify
him now. Nothing could terrify him now except, perhaps,
the idea of a robber.</p>

<p>It was extraordinary, the effect of this fortune on this
imaginative mind, stiffening and strengthening it against
all imaginary fears save the fear of material enemies. The
man who dreads burglars has no time to dream of ghosts.</p>

<p>Immediately on waking he turned and placed his hand
upon the treasure, then he sat up facing the brave, bright
morning; it was all true, then, despite his dreams and his
visionary enemies he was still in possession of this incredible
and fantastic wealth; his mind, clear now and strengthened
by sleep, could grasp the matter in its true proportions;
the stuff was his by all right, he was lineal heir
by the right of labour and suffering, to the fortune that
Sagesse had taken from the hand of Chance.</p>

<p>He could go to M. Seguin with a clear conscience and
ask him to help in the disposal of these things.</p>

<p>He rose up and walked along the beach, every moment
casting back an eye at the place where the treasure was.
The storm had brought treasure of its own to the beach,
other than gems, and the falling tide was leaving behind
it strips of emerald and clear-brown seaweed, starfish,
seaweed whose roots were clinging still to fragments of
red branch coral, great bunches of flying-fish eggs like
bunches of white currants, shells shewing all the tints of
opal and pearl.</p>

<p>The great hand of the storm had stripped the sea coves,
the tidal rocks, the gardens of the lagoons, and had cast
the coloured harvest on the sand; the sea itself had a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
brighter look, a fresher smell; great depths seemed to
have been stirred and the freshness and youth that lie at
the heart of ocean to have been diffused through its being.</p>

<p>O, the vision of the morning sea! The blue distance,
the green, curling waves, the blowing wind; it is the only
thing that never grows old; unspoiled by time or change,
it is to-day as it was when Jason sailed it, when Helen
knew it, when the blue-painted triremes clashed beaks at
Salamis in the morning of the world.</p>

<p>When we first saw Gaspard, a stoker fresh from the
<i>Rhone</i>, sitting under a palm tree smoking and waiting for
Yves, he was a man who would have been moved not at all
by the youth and spirit of this morning sea; the crushed
aesthetic sense, the imagination that had been subdued to
bar rooms and girls of the type of Anisette, would have
responded scarcely at all to this hilarity of blue waves
and morning light—but it was different now. He had
changed and the world had changed; the change was perhaps
more subtle than profound, altering rather the point
of view than the viewer, yet he had changed. He had
learned to expand his nostrils to the breeze, to feel pleasure
in the morning light, and satisfaction in the sense of being.</p>

<p>As he stood looking away to southward over the blue
sea, he heard the voice of the spirit that had mostly
wrought the change in him. It was the voice of Martinique
calling to him, the voice of Marie.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ché.</i></p>

<p>In a moment and for a moment, Fortune, the island,
everything, was forgotten.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ché.</i></p>

<p>The little word came on the breeze to him. Was she,
too, standing on some beach or headland gazing over the
sea towards him? Was the little word a butterfly of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
thought blown to him on the breeze that was blowing from
there?</p>

<p>Who can say, but he heard it as distinctly as he had
heard it that evening when standing on the road to Morne
Rouge and looking down at St. Pierre, he had waited for
her and she had come to him.</p>

<p>He turned away from the sea, then he turned to it
again and swept the horizon as though looking for a sail.
There was nothing to be seen.</p>

<p>He walked back along the sea edge in the direction of
the palms; the seven palms had been cast down by the
rush of the hurricane, just as the stakes of a stock fence
might be cast down by the rush of wild cattle; now, and
for the first time, the thought occurred to Gaspard that
with the palms gone the islet would be less likely to attract
the attention of a passing ship. He looked at them
as they lay, and then he approached the bundle of treasure
and the glittering snake of gold, which were lying by the
bole of the westernmost of the fallen trees. He touched
the bundle with his foot. The action seemed half involuntary;
he did not seem to be thinking of the bundle or its
contents. Nor was he.</p>

<p>He was thinking of Marie.</p>

<p>A wild longing, such as the prisoned bird may feel for
the blue sky, filled him, subordinating everything else to
the thought of the being he loved.</p>

<p>Ever since <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> had dropped Martinique
behind her this longing had been living and growing in
his heart; the treasure fever had obscured it, the storm
had veiled it, the finding of the treasure had pushed it
aside, but it was there, growing, and patiently waiting.
It was the master passion of his life, the thing beside
which all other things were nothing, though for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
they might veil it, as a cloud veils a star, or a mist a
mountain.</p>

<p>He turned away from the treasure and walked towards
the bushes, then he began to cross the islet, taking the
path that Sagesse’s sailors had made for the boat. Though
he was profoundly engaged in thought, he noticed quite
little things, as, for instance, that the salt crystals were
nearly gone from the leaves of the bay-cedar bushes.</p>

<p>Half way across, where a view of the northern horizon
could be obtained, he raised his head and scanned the
sea line. Nothing—nothing—Ah! stop! What was that?</p>

<p>A tiny flake of feldspar seemed clinging to the sky
horizon in N.N.W. In the wonderful half wheel of crystal
blue this microscopic flaw might have been passed over
by a casual observer. Gaspard folded his arms and
stood gazing at this speck, his lips parted in a half smile,
his eyes fixed. Had you been close to him, you would
have noticed that he scarcely breathed.</p>

<p>The thing did not seem to alter in shape or increase
in size, yet he knew that it represented the topsails of a
ship hull down on the horizon. It was just so that he had
first glimpsed <i>La Belle Arlésienne</i> from the open boat.</p>

<p>Then it increased in size. After keeping him in suspense
for what seemed an age, suddenly his brain was able to
say of the vision upon his retina, “It is bigger.”</p>

<p>Then, as he watched it increase, all doubt passed: It
was a vessel of some sort steering southward. The wind
was blowing now steady from E.S.E.; she would pass
the island to westward, perhaps quite close, for it was
all deep water there.</p>

<p>His mind, up to the moment of sighting the sail, had
been filled with the thought of Marie, the craving for her
had brought him here to look out for a sail. Now, after the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
first joyous leap of the heart, Marie was for the moment
forgotten. It was as though the sail space on the sky
had been a doorway through which the world had rushed in
upon him.</p>

<p>He turned and ran back to the southern beach, picked
up the treasure bundle and forced it into his pocket, picked
up the jewelled snake and placed it round his neck under
his shirt.</p>

<p>The collar of the flannel shirt scarcely concealed it; it
would never do to board a vessel with such a gem so
lightly concealed, so, hurriedly, with absurd haste, as
though the ship were already abreast of the island and
there was not a moment to lose, he stripped off his coat
and shirt. For a moment he thought of placing it round
his waist, but it was not long enough to serve as a belt—then
he did what the jeweller who had designed the thing
intended its wearer to do—made an armlet of it.</p>

<p>It clung to perfection, and he resumed his shirt and coat.
The banknote that he had taken from the pocket-book of
Sagesse, the white pearl, and the gold coin, were all in
the left hand coat pocket; he felt them over with his left
hand whilst his right examined again the bulge made by
the jewels contained in the right hand pocket.</p>

<p>It was not so very noticeable and no one would have
dreamed that it was caused by treasure. He looked around
him on the sand to make sure that he had forgotten nothing,
and then came back to the vantage point in the centre
of the islet.</p>

<p>Yes, there she was, palpable to the sight and definite,
no longer a smudge on the sky-line, but a vessel with all
sail set and steering, one would have thought, straight for
the islet.</p>

<p>Then, assured of this, he set to with his sheath knife,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
cutting dead brushwood and heaping it on the pathway;
the smoke of a signal fire was his only chance of attracting
her attention; and having made his preparations he
knelt down by the heap and put his hand in his trousers
pocket for his tinder box and steel.</p>

<p>It was gone.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XLIII"></a>CHAPTER XLIII<br />

<span class="subhead">DELIVERANCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For a moment he knelt helpless, with idle hands. He
knew quite well that though the vessel seemed steering
straight for the island, she might pass it a long distance
away; a smoke signal could not but attract her attention,
yet he was debarred from making it.</p>

<p>The tricky spirit that seemed to haunt the islet seemed
still active and at work, filling his pockets with jewels,
yet holding back from him the means of escape.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and stared about him, trying to
remember when he had last lit his pipe; then he came back
along the pathway to the beach, searching the ground, the
sand, casting his eyes hither and thither, the sweat running
from every pore. He searched the whole width of the
beach for twenty yards from the fallen palm trees towards
the coral spur; the gulls were calling and fishing as of
old and their voices seemed mocking him, he, who, burning
for action, had yet to walk up and down slowly as an old
man, with head bent and eyes cast before him after the
fashion of a penitent.</p>

<p>There was no sign of the box; it was a small affair, one
of those cheap nickel tinder boxes they sell to sailors, a
“smoker’s friend” containing a wheel armed with a bit
of flint, a spring which rotated the wheel, and a tiny wick
which caught the spark.</p>

<p>He was turning from the beach in despair when his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
foot struck against what seemed a pebble half covered by
sand. It was the “smoker’s friend.” It had fallen last
night from his pocket and the wind had blown the sand
over it. He seized it and with it in his hand came running
back to the heap of brushwood. He first turned his eyes
to the ship. She was larger, nearer, yet seemingly farther
from the track of the island; as far as he could judge she
might pass it by some three miles. He flung himself on
his knees by the heap of brushwood and pressing the
spring of the tinder box, struck a spark. It caught on the
inflammable wick, the wick smouldered, and then, as he
blew at it, broke into flame. It was a very small flame,
not nearly as big as that given by a large sized wax match.
Then he approached the tiny point of light to one of the
dead twigs of the brushwood. He was kneeling with his
back to the wind so as to protect the flame, but for all his
care a breath across his shoulder blew it out.</p>

<p>He cursed. Then holding the box close to his body, he
re-lit the wick.</p>

<p>The wetting the box had received during the hurricane
must have damaged its spirit; yesterday when he had lit
his pipe with it he had done so with great difficulty, but the
flame was even more feeble to-day; it went out again at
the critical moment, and again, and again; the brushwood,
perhaps, from the effect of the sea-salt that had dried
upon it, was hard to ignite; had he but a piece of paper
the task would have been easy, but there was not a scrap
on the island.</p>

<p>Then he remembered Sagesse’s pocket-book, which he
had buried in the sand. He was rising to hunt for it
when he remembered also the banknote that he had taken
from the papers of Sagesse and which was in his pocket.</p>

<p>To find the pocket-book might take a long time, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
sand had blown smoothly over the place where he had
buried it; the banknote was to his hand and would burn
bravely. It did.</p>

<p>As it took light, and as its flame took the brushwood, a
burst of discordant cries came from the fishing ground of
the gulls away to the southeast. They were fighting over
some fish, no doubt, or some offal of the sea cast shoreward,
yet as the blue smoke curled upwards and as the
last of the five hundred franc note burnt Gaspard’s fingers,
one might have fancied that they were shouting in
derision:</p>

<p>“There goes the first of your fortune in smoke—smoke—smoke.
Hi, you there amidst the bushes, think you to
escape us with Serpente’s treasure? It is ours—Hi! do
you hear? It is ours—ours—ours—Our voices will follow
you wherever it goes, bringing weariness, desolation—death—Hi!
Hi! Hi!”</p>

<p>Absurdity, of course, yet the voices of the gulls were
a part of the fatefulness of that place, with the blinding
light and the desolation, they made its personality—after
all, was it absurdity or poetry on the part of the castaway
to read into all that a menace, to feel Serpente’s fist still
closed upon his treasure, to hear the voices of his sailors in
the voices of the gulls. No man can say who has not heard
the spirit of the sea speak on the quays of Florida, by the
lagoons of the coast, on the islands of the Caribbean—who
has not seen Laropé’s topsails break the horizon,
leading into poor reality the hull of some trading ship, or
heard the gulls of the lagoons telling the fate of the old
buccaneers.</p>

<p>Now the bonfire was burning bravely, and Gaspard, attacking
the bay cedars with his knife, cast younger wood
upon the flames; it damped them down, but it gave smoke,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
blankets and spirals of blue-grey smoke, thickening, deepening,
and at last rising in a steady column. He ran to
the fallen palm trees and hacked away their fronds, half
dried and half withered by the sea; they increased the
flame and more green brushwood increased the smoke.</p>

<p>It was now magnificent, a pillar of darkness rising in
the air, bending to the wind and breaking into fronds of
smoke.</p>

<p>He left it, and shading his eyes stared out across the
sea. The vessel was almost abreast of the island, about
three miles away to northward, scarcely two miles to westward;
she was a small vessel, ship rigged; that is to say,
with square sails on all her three masts; she would not
be more than two hundred and fifty or three hundred tons.</p>

<p>The wind had veered almost into the east, so she had it
on her beam.</p>

<p>She seemed indifferent to all things and as divorced
from reality as a painted ship in some brilliant picture of
the sea. Never did it seem possible that she would respond
to call or signal.</p>

<p>She was abreast of the island now—and now—Gaspard
could scarcely believe his eyes—she was altering her
course; the wind was spilling from her sails—she was
heaving to.</p>

<p>He saw a boat detach itself from her, a tiny speck at
first, now larger, now plainly visible; it was making, not
for the western side, but for the southern beach, where the
landing was good. Evidently the vessel knew the island
and had landed a boat here before.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="vspace"><a id="CHAPTER_XLIV"></a>CHAPTER XLIV<br />

<span class="subhead">SIMON STOCK</span></h2>
</div>

<p>He made for the beach and stood there waiting. The
rocks to westward cut off his view of the oncoming boat
and he had time for a moment’s thought.</p>

<p>He felt like an actor who had to appear on the stage
with a half-learned part. Thinking entirely of how to
hide his treasure, he had forgotten to invent a story to
account for his presence on the island.</p>

<p>It was too late now, for here came the boat’s nose
round the western rocks, a large, white-painted boat, flashing
eight oars in the sun.</p>

<p>Now she was coming dead on for the beach and Gaspard
was wading out knee-deep to meet her. Within ten
strokes of the beach, the men ceased rowing and she came
bravely on, the bow oar standing up and shouting something
in English which Gaspard did not understand; he
waved and shouted a reply in French and the next moment
he was clutching the thwart, being hauled aboard and
shoved aft.</p>

<p>The mate of the vessel, who was steering, a hatchet-faced
American, hauled Gaspard down beside him and
without waiting for word or question, which would have
been useless, considering that he could scarcely speak
a syllable of French, shouted orders to the crew and the
boat poled off from the shore and began its return journey
to the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
“French?” said the mate, when they were under way.</p>

<p>Gaspard nodded, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Oui</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">oui</i>,” then pointing behind him,
“wreck;” it was one of the few English words that he
knew. The hands in the boat, all Americans, lean-faced,
bronze, chewing as they rowed, looked with interest at
the marooned one and made remarks about him one to the
other, but the mate, after the first interrogation, seemed
to have no interest in anything but getting back to the
ship as quickly as possible. There was a life belt in the
stern of the boat with the words “Anne Martin” on it.</p>

<p>Gaspard pointed to the name and then at the ship
they were approaching.</p>

<p>“Anne Martine?” asked he.</p>

<p>The mate nodded and spat into the sea.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Quelle porte?</i>” asked Gaspard, pointing southward.</p>

<p>“St. Pierre.”</p>

<p>“<em>St. Pierre!</em>” cried Gaspard. “<em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">O mon Dieu, St. Pierre—St.
Pierre Martinique?</em>”</p>

<p>The mate nodded.</p>

<p>For a moment Gaspard could not believe that such luck
was his. Out of thirty or forty possible ports she was
bound for St. Pierre, for Marie. Then he laughed and
clapped his knees with his hands; the oarsmen laughed half
mockingly, poking fun at him in American slang, but the
mate did not laugh, he was a man who, to use his own
expression, had no use for laughter, besides, his eyes and
his mind were otherwise engaged.</p>

<p>Gaspard, in his excitement over lighting the signal fire
and the approach of the boat, had forgotten one thing. He
was wearing the diamond ring he had taken from Sagesse,
a terrible blunder, almost unbelievable, did not one know
the capacity of the human mind for error.</p>

<p>The mate, he was first officer of the <i>Anne Martin</i> and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
name was Skinner—though he could scarcely keep his eyes
from the flashing jewel, said nothing, and now the boat was
under the port quarter of the <i>Anne Martin</i>, oars were in
and Gaspard climbing the ladder which had been flung
down, whilst a hard-faced man in a panama, Captain Stock,
no less, the master of the vessel, was leaning over the side
shouting directions to the mate.</p>

<p>In a moment the crew were on board, the boat swung up
at the davits, the braces manned and the <i>Anne Martin</i> on
her course again.</p>

<p>Then, and not till then, did Captain Stock turn to the
new-comer.</p>

<p>“He’s French,” said Skinner, “wrecked over there, but
he’s got a diamond on his finger worth ten thousand dollars
that wants explaining.”</p>

<p>The Captain glanced at Gaspard, fixed his eyes on the
ring and then said, “Call Diego, he can chatter to him,
it’s all the d——d Dago is good for.”</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Gaspard, seeing Captain
Stock’s gaze fixed on his hand, recognised that he was
wearing the ring.</p>

<p>In a moment Diego, a fat Portugee, with black curls and
earrings, came running aft. Then, through the mediumship
of this interpreter, Captain Stock began to question
the marooned one.</p>

<p>“How long have you been wrecked?”</p>

<p>“Some days.”</p>

<p>“Storm or what?”</p>

<p>“Storm.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get that ring you are wearing?”</p>

<p>“Found it.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“On the island.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
“Picked it up?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“On the beach.”</p>

<p>Here Gaspard broke across the questions with a statement.</p>

<p>“Tell M. le Capitaine the ring is mine. I found it, and
I shall sell it at St. Pierre and pay him handsomely for my
passage. I have friends at St. Pierre who can speak for
me. I want to go on this ship as a passenger; not to work
my passage.”</p>

<p>“Who can you name at St. Pierre as a friend?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Seguin—Paul Seguin.”</p>

<p>The name appeared to have an effect upon Captain
Stock.</p>

<p>“What was the name of your ship?”</p>

<p>“<i>La Belle Arlésienne.</i>”</p>

<p>No sooner had the words left Gaspard’s mouth than an
extraordinary change took place in the face of the Captain;
long enough by nature, it lengthened still more. He came
forward and grasped Gaspard’s arm.</p>

<p>“<i>La Belle Arlésienne!!!</i>”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Oui.</i>”</p>

<p>“Belonging to Pierre Sagesse?”</p>

<p>“Pierre Sagesse—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">oui</i>.”</p>

<p>“Was he on board—Hi, you d——d Dago, ask him was
Pierre Sagesse aboard.”</p>

<p>Diego put the question.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Was he lost?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He’s dead—sure?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
“Yes—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">O ma foi</i>, yes. I left him with the crabs eating
him.”</p>

<p>Stock had been one of Pierre Sagesse’s many victims.
Stock was not owner of the <i>Anne Martin</i>, only master, but
he had once owned a ship in the West India trade, had
become involved in Sagesse’s net and ruined. The hatred
of hell would scarcely express in words the hatred of Simon
Stock for Pierre Sagesse. No wonder, then, that he did
what he did on the news of Pierre Sagesse’s death and the
statement about the crabs, and what he did was this. Flung
up his chin till his scrawny and vulturous neck was sunlit
from hyoid bone to sternum, clicked his fingers like castanets,
laughed horribly, called the hands aft, ordered Skinner
to serve them out a tot of rum all round and, then, taking
Gaspard by the arm, led him down the companion-way
to the dismal place that went by the name of the saloon.</p>

<p>He opened the door of a dog hole that had served once
for a third officer’s cabin and Diego, who had followed,
translating, he said:</p>

<p>“You can berth here and for nothing, the news that Peer
Sagesse is in hell is all the payment I want. Make yourself
at home, sonny, call for what you want, drinks <em>or</em>
smokes and dinner’s at eight bells.”</p>

<p>Then he turned on his heel and went on deck, followed by
Diego, leaving Gaspard to settle into his new quarters. A
palace would not have pleased him better at the moment,
than this dingy place. He had dreaded being berthed in
the fo’cs’le, to have carried a fortune of many thousands of
pounds in gems into such a place, to live in that mixed
community for several weeks and to keep the fortune hidden
would have been a difficult task indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Here it was perfectly simple, there was an upper and
a lower bunk, each with a mattress, there was no steward,
so Diego had told him, so there would be no one fussing
about making beds. He took the bundle from his pocket
and placed it in a corner of the upper bunk under the mattress,
as he did so he felt the absolute physical pleasure
that comes when the body is relieved of a heavy load. He
could move now freely and having closed the door of the
cabin, he came on deck.</p>

<span class="subhead">MOUNT PELÉE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The good fortune that had followed him pursued also the
<i>Anne Martin</i>, the wind held steady, the sky clear; flying,
fresh weather and a sparkling sea brought her into the
Caribbean; they sighted ships but always at a distance,
sails that flecked the far off horizon and vanished, long
wreaths of steamer smoke, phantoms speaking as vaguely
of the world of men as the strips of fucus floating past on
the swell.</p>

<p>Not only had they good weather but good temper reigned
on board.</p>

<p>Stock, a “hard case” in the language of sailors, had taken
in, with the news of Sagesse’s death, a cargo of good
humour that promised to last him till they fetched Martinique.</p>

<p>Gaspard had his meals in the cabin, with the few words
of English that he knew and a few more that he picked up
daily, he could make his wants understood without the
assistance of Diego; as for conversation, he did just as well
with his half dozen words as with a thousand, for conversation
there was none amidst the after guard of the <i>Anne
Martin</i>.</p>

<p>As day followed day and Martinique crept closer to
them, so did the idea of Marie grow in Gaspard’s mind,
ousting the idea of Fortune and all other ideas and preoccupations.
Just as, on the approach to Skeleton Island,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
the vision of treasure drove her image from his mind, now
on his approach to Martinique, so did her image cast out
the vision of treasure. If he thought of his wealth at all,
it was only connection with her.</p>

<p>One night, under a sky blazing with stars, he was standing
on deck watching the phosporescent gleams in the water.
Captain Stock, who had just emerged from the cabin companion-way
came towards him, leaned over the bulwark,
took his cigar from his mouth and expectorated into the
sea.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” said the Captain, pointing right ahead.</p>

<p>Gaspard started.</p>

<p>“Martinique?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Then the Captain went forward, leaving Gaspard alone.</p>

<p>He knew they were close to the island, but he had not
reckoned that they were so near as that.</p>

<p>To-morrow, he would see Marie to-morrow. To-morrow,
he would be walking the pleasant sunlit streets of St.
Pierre, he remembered the shops of the Rue Victor Hugo.
O, what would he not buy her! He would take her and
say, “All St. Pierre is yours—take what you please.”</p>

<p>Then he cast his thoughts abroad, all through St. Pierre,
wandering hither and thither, and touching this person, and
that, with a loving hand. Man’m Faly, Pierre-Alphonse,
the girls who were Marie’s friends. Finotte, Honorine,
Lys, they would all share in his jubilee, and there was
something grim in the idea that the pleasantest thing he was
bringing with him, the thing that would make him most
welcome in the coloured city, was the news of Pierre Sagesse’s
death.</p>

<p>He went below and turned in, and fell asleep with his
mind full of these pleasant imaginings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
This was the season of the most heavy rains and he had
been asleep scarcely an hour when the <i>Anne Martin</i> sailed
into a rain squall, and the thunder of rain on the deck
reached him in dreamland.</p>

<p>The scenery of his dreams at once took the form of the
little Place de la Fontaine, where he had first met Marie.
He was walking there with her and the sun was shining
brightly, the sky was blue. Then, all at once, he lost her.
She had vanished amidst the crowd of dream people who
were strolling through the Place.</p>

<p>Then, just as on the day he first met her “clash—ripple—clash”
came the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carillon</i> of the cathedral bells, but they
did not bring him to Marie, clouds darkened the sky and
the thunder of rain filled the air, and through it all the
bells ringing on joyous, triumphant, golden, like the voice
of the love that lives beyond disaster and death—Then he
awoke.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark and the thunder of the rain on deck
was ceasing.</p>

<p>He lay awake for an hour and then he slept again, only
to repeat the dream.</p>

<p>A little after dawn he awoke with the bells sounding so
loudly in his ears that he could have sworn they were
anchored in the bay and that the cathedral was greeting
them with a peal, but he knew by the movement of the ship
that this was not so.</p>

<p>He put his hand into the upper bunk, and taking the
treasure bundle from beneath the mattress, put it in his
pocket. Then he came on deck.</p>

<p>The sun had already shewed himself just above the horizon,
but the sky was clouded to southward and rain squalls
dimmed the horizon.</p>

<p>S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E. and perhaps not more than ten miles away lay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Martinique with Pelée wrapped in ragged and dirty-coloured
clouds. He looked like a king whose robes had gone
to tatters till the sun rising more fully, touched him with
gold, and white, and pearl against the deepening blue of the
sky.</p>

<p>Gaspard gazed awhile at this majestic sight. They had
not opened the Bay of St. Pierre yet, but the <i>Anne Martin</i>
was already altering her course and in half an hour or less
they would have the bay and city full in view.</p>

<p>Dominica to eastward lay unclouded, haze-blue upon the
morning sea, beautiful as a dream.</p>

<p>Gaspard, turning from the weather bulwarks on which
he had been leaning, began to cut some tobacco in the palm
of his hand and to fill his pipe. Whilst he was engaged in
this business, he heard a hurried footstep and Skinner
came running aft.</p>

<p>The mate darted down the companion-way to the cabin
and almost immediately reappeared with a telescope; after
him came Captain Stock, a pair of marine glasses in his
hand.</p>

<p>The two men went forward to the bow. Gaspard followed
them. He judged from their manner that something
of interest had hove in sight and he was not wrong; leaning
against the weather bulwarks a little forward of the foremast,
Skinner clapped the glass to his eye and pointed it
at Martinique. Stock raised his binoculars. At that moment,
there was nothing to be seen, for the clouds on Pelée
had fanned out and the bay of St. Pierre was veiled by
sheets of sun-dazzled rain, then, against the vanishing
clouds, slowly appeared the stem of a broken arch, the foot
of a rainbow. It passed with the clouds and the sun struck
Martinique.</p>

<p>The sun was high now and it struck the western coast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
over the shoulders of Pelée and the mountains; not a cloud
lingered upon the island, except a cloud, a cone of smoke
rising from Pelée, yet to Gaspard as he strained his eyes,
it seemed that a thick grey cloud clung to Pelée from apex
to base, clung to St. Pierre, veiling the coloured houses
utterly from sight, and to the whole arc of the bay, hiding
the trees, the triumphant palms, the angelines, the tamarinds.</p>

<p>“My God!” said Skinner. The hand that held the glass
was shaking, his face had become bloodless under its bronze.
Captain Stock, the binoculars still glued to his eyes, was
talking rapidly to himself in an undertone. Gaspard, who
could not see as they saw, who could not understand as they
understood, could, yet, comprehend dimly the terror before
him, sunlit, and facing the gem-like sea.</p>

<p>St. Pierre had vanished utterly, Pelée was no longer the
verdant mountain towering triumphantly above the flower-like
city; a cone of dismal ashes smoking to the sky, above
a land of dismal ashes, that was all there was left of that
lovely world. And it was all so still, so peaceful with the
peace that hangs over ruins of great antiquity!</p>

<p>Yet, but a few weeks ago, Pelée was youthful with foliage,
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canotiers</i> were paddling in the sapphire bay, the
city was waving its flags to the sun, mirroring its coloured
houses in the water. The children were singing their songs
and telling their Tim-Tim in the streets. The market-place
was gay with life, the gardens gay with colour, the streets
with laughter and over all hung the poetry of eternal summer.
And now all that was with Thebes, with Nineveh—a
world of ashes, desolation, silence.</p>

<p>Stock, the Yankee skipper, a man whom few things could
move, lowered the glasses, pressed his left hand tight over
his eyes as if they had been hurt by some painful light and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
then, leaning over the bulwarks, became violently sick.</p>

<p>Gaspard, who had seized the glasses from his hand,
looked. As he looked he swayed from side to side as though
the vision before him had grasped him by the shoulders and
he was wrestling with it.</p>

<p>Skinner caught him as the glasses fell from his hand. He
had fainted and Diego, with the assistance of another sailor
carried him below and put him in his bunk.</p>

<p>Captain Stock and the mate followed, they loosed his
collar and left him lying whilst they sat down at the saloon
table and Diego fetched them rum.</p>

<p>It was British Navy rum, thirty above proof and it gave
them the stiffening they required.</p>

<p>“It’s that cursed mountain,” said Stock at last. “She’s
blown her side out—must have occurred just after we left
Boston or we’d have had news of it by cable from some of
the other islands, sure.”</p>

<p>They rose to go on deck, but before doing so they looked
in to see how Gaspard was doing.</p>

<p>He had recovered consciousness, but he lay like a man
dazed after some terrible accident. His eyes were fixed as
if on some form seen only by himself and on his cheek
there were tears.</p>

<p>They spoke to him and he heard, but he made no reply,
only a movement of the hand as though to say, “Let me be.”</p>

<span class="subhead">ASHES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When they came on deck, the vessel, still on her course
had drawn nearer to the land, several men-of-war and
relief ships were at anchor in the bay.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Anne Martin</i> were held spellbound by
the disaster, just as their officers had been. Nor did use to
the scene break the spell, for the nearer they approached
the more appalling did the picture of destruction appear.</p>

<p>Had you not known of the catastrophe, had you not
known that this place a few weeks ago was the most beautiful
corner of the world, you would have said, “this is surely
the great cinder dumping ground of the universe. Here
from the beginning of time men have cast their ashes and
cities their detritus, if I were to poke a stick amidst all
that I would surely find amphorae from Sparta and broken
gourds from Nineveh along with the empty tomato tins
and the broken crockery-ware of the modern world. What
a horror. How dare Time expose this rubbish heap to
insult the gaze of the Creator, this monstrosity of desolation
to insult the eye of man.”</p>

<p>And even then you would not have felt the heart of this
great desolation, you would not have heard the voices of
the gardens, the complaint of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fleur d’amour</i>, the weeping
of the gouyave water, the voices of the vanished streets.
You would not have known that beneath that miserable rubbish
of nature, that dust, grey as the brick dust of the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
grey temple of Ruin, lay children grasping their toys, girls
once more beautiful than the flowers in the gardens, men,
young, and brave, but a few weeks ago, and filled with the
joy of life, Pierre-Alphonse, the kindly fisherman and
Man’m Faly the good-hearted friend of sailors.</p>

<p>Even still, amidst the ruin one might see some trace of
the configuration of the city, just as in a face ruined by some
terrible disease one may recognize the ghosts of features.</p>

<p>A gun followed by a signal from one of the war vessels,
made the <i>Anne Martin</i> heave to. The bay was full of
wrecks and dangerous to navigation. In-shore lay the
cable ship <i>Grappler</i>, sunk with all hands, further out all
the shipping that had been in the bay on that fateful morning
lay fathoms deep withered by the burning scoriae—all
save the <i>Roddam</i>, that gallant ship saved by the energy
and heroism of her commander.</p>

<p>Warned by a boat from the warship, Captain Stock put
the <i>Anne Martin</i> about and made for Fort de France down
the coast, there to wait for orders from the owners.</p>

<p>When the vessel was on her new course, he went down to
see how Gaspard was doing. He was lying just as he had
been left, still staring straight before him, not vacantly,
but as if at some definite vision.</p>

<p>When he had looked through the marine glasses, when
he had swept the scene of destruction from smoking Pelée
to the sea, the whole tragedy was made plain to him, even
to its cause. The place he loved, all that he loved, everything
that meant life to him had vanished.</p>

<p>His was the greatest tragedy in which a man has ever
been condemned to act. He had sailed, leaving the lovely
city and the woman he loved gazing at him until dimmed
by the veil of distance, he had returned, raised the veil, and
found—this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
The immensity of it almost made it a thing impersonal
without in the least destroying the anguish of it. As he
lay there in his bunk he saw Marie and he saw himself, he
saw the city. He saw the Rue Victor Hugo and the blue
sky, the Place du Fort, and the waving tamarinds; he heard
the voices of the people and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">carillon</i> of the cathedral
bells, and all that seemed the scenery of a beautiful play,
acted under a summer sky in a land of impossible happiness—gone
now as though it had never been.</p>

<p>Marie had never been, surely she had never been, never
had he met her in the Place de la Fontaine. Those coloured
streets, those gay people, that town of pictures, those
flowers, and trees, all that was an illusion so it seemed to
his mind, whilst his heart, broken, yet still beating, told
him indistinctly that all this had been, living, warm, and
real. Real as Marie now dead and lost to him forever.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FOOTSTEP IN THE DUST</span></h2>
</div>

<p>St. Pierre had passed away and with St. Pierre, Marie,
and with Marie his will to live.</p>

<p>The extraordinary and most tragically poetic part of his
drama was the manner in which St. Pierre, the lost city,
clung to the vision of the woman he loved.</p>

<p>She wore it as a garment; he saw her surrounded by its
beauty; dawn lit her in the Street of the Precipice, morn in
the music-haunted Place de la Fontaine; evening in the
twilit Jardin des Plantes.</p>

<p>The super-mortal tragedy of the city had raised her
image to supernal heights. The passion, the agony that
lives alone in the highest poetry had mixed itself in this
common man’s tragedy. The city obliterated from the
world was part of his grief.</p>

<p>As he lay like a man fascinated by a serpent, motionless,
scarcely seeming to breathe, with eyes fixed, and pupils
dilated, the roar of the anchor-chain through the hawse pipe
shook the vessel. He sat up, leaning on his elbow, exactly as
a man sits up who has been awakened suddenly from sleep.</p>

<p>A disc of reflected sunlight, liquid and tremulous as
the water from which it was reflected, was cast by the porthole
upon the wall of the cabin; it trembled and moved to
the motion of the vessel as she rocked at her moorings.</p>

<p>He gazed at it, following it with his eyes as it leapt
and quivered; then, slipping from the bunk he stood erect
on the floor of the cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
He was fully dressed and, in the act of stepping from
the bunk, his full strength seemed to have returned to him.
He opened the door of the cabin and a moment later he was
on deck.</p>

<p>All the crew were gathered forward; a boat was rowing
away from the ship, Captain Stock and the mate were in
it, and they were making for the nearest war-ship. The
<i>Anne Martin</i> was close in shore and the vast, formless,
blanketed city cast its chill gray reflection on the water
of the harbour. Mounds of ashes terraced by the heavy
rains, wildernesses of ashes mounting to wildernesses of
ashes, ghosts of buildings vaguely outlined beneath their
cerement of ashes—cinders, dust, and ashes, and from all
that immensity of desolation not a sound, save now and
then a call from one of the working parties, half invisible
amidst the ruins.</p>

<p>He cast his eyes over it all and then up to Pelée still
fuming in the windless blue; like a madman, exhausted, the
great mountain seemed inexpressibly sinister above the
ruins of the city it had protected for long years, fed with
the gouyave water, sheltered from the winds. Gaspard
stretched out his arms, his fingers were crooked, it was as
though the man were saying to the mountain, “Ah, what
would I not do with you, if I only had you in my grip!”</p>

<p>Then he clambered over the starboard rail.</p>

<p>The men forward did not hear the splash, nor did they
notice the black head of the swimmer passing towards the
shore.</p>

<p>He had not even kicked off the deck shoes he was wearing,
he swam with ease and half unconsciously; in his condition
all things were possible to him, he would have guided
his way through a turbulent sea just as surely as across
this summer-smooth harbour. And now he was clinging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
to the angle of a great block of stone shaken out from the
once quay-wall and slobbered round by the tide. He dragged
himself on to it, and from it to the next.</p>

<p>The Place Bertine had been here; here in the sunlight
the tamarinds had shaken their leaves to the wind and cast
dancing shadows on the sun-smitten pavement, the songs of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canotiers</i> had mixed with the sounds of trade—here
where tamarind trees would bloom no more; where the
blasting scoriae had fused broken stones and broken building;
where the sunlight was horrible.</p>

<p>Around him lay nothing but mounds where once the
sugar barrels had been piled, where buildings had been.
Mounds like the sand dunes on a desolate coast. A little
wind had arisen and, just as amidst the dunes the wind
brings the whisper of sand, here, it brought the faint silky
whisper of dust.</p>

<p>He had no objective—no object, here, but to feel the
ruin; to touch it, walk amidst it, become part of it. To
torture his soul. All this was her bed, the dust he trod
on her winding sheet, the desolation her silence.</p>

<p>He passed amidst the mounds. In the great mountain of
ashes before him the rains had washed out what seemed the
bed of a mountain torrent. It had once been a street. He
began to climb it. This horrible ravine was tainted by a
faint sickly smell of corruption, the crust of the scoriae
broke beneath his feet so that he plunged sometimes knee-deep,
the sweat ran from his brow, and the sun struck
fiercely on him. The heat was terrific. Never, even in the
old days of the stokehold, had he experienced such heat,
yet still he climbed.</p>

<p>He had reached, now, a transverse ravine, a huge donga
with steep banks from which here and there broke out the
walls of ruined houses. It was the Rue Victor Hugo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
The silence here was terrible, the silence of Nineveh, the
silence of the Nothing, which is at the heart of things.
Finotte and Lys; the corrossole sellers; the merchants and
traffickers; the coloured crowd; the little children—nothing
spoke of them here.</p>

<p>And, still, far above him went the mountain of ashes, the
broken streets, walls that had once been houses, charred
stumps that had once been palm trees. And still he climbed.
He had cast off his coat, never thinking of the treasure
in its pocket, he had forgotten all that, even Marie had
become vague as a ghost in his mind. One thing only stood
clearly before him, half-mesmerised as he was by exhaustion,
heat, and the ruin around him—the beach of Grande
Anse. The soot-black beach and the green curling waves
where a man might find oblivion. He did not know in the
least that it was the vision of Marie that was calling him
to the cliffs, where he had first truly met her face to face.</p>

<p>At noon, broken, dazed, grimed with dust, having a dozen
times escaped by a miracle from death, he reached the summit
of the ruins of St. Pierre, and the path of ashes that had
once been the road to Morne Rouge. Gazing from here,
and not glancing at the ruined city, nothing had altered.
The sea lay the same as of old, and Dominica shewed
ghostly and haze-blue on the far sea line, gulls were flying
over the bay. Eternal summer sat by the ruined city, voiceless,
and lost in eternal sleep. Though the silence of the
Rue Victor Hugo had been broken by no sound, up here,
could be heard a faint breathing from the sea. The requiem
of the ocean whose tide was now flooding into the bay.</p>

<p>“Ah, the palms, the coloured houses, the old sea-steps
I used to wash—the voices of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">canotiers</i>, the tall ships
I brought thee, where are they?” Vaguely, like a voice
heard in a dream came the whispered lament of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Gaspard did not hear it. He paused only to rest and
breathe, he had slipped and fallen many times in his ascent;
coatless, his arms were clay-coloured with sweat-caked
volcanic dust; his face was frightful; grimed and seamed—it
looked as though spat upon by Ruin. In a few short
hours his eyes had become sunken, his cheeks had fallen
in; his lips baked and parched, and caked with dust were
inhuman, the lips of a tragic mask of antiquity. A frightful
thirst filled him, obliterating all other feelings. Beneath
him lay the city, formless and bulked out with cinders
and dust, exactly as the ship of coral had once lain beneath
him bulked out with coral in the still lagoon.</p>

<p>Ah, that night when he had turned with Yves from the
vision of the sunken ship, feeling that what he had seen was
evil; could he but have seen this greater vision! This
greater story of man’s futility and the fate of the imaginers
of vain things!</p>

<p>He turned, seeing nothing of it all but the great white
sheet of light that leapt from the horizon half-way to the
zenith, and the dazzle of the sea.</p>

<p>He came along the path of cinders that had once been a
road set with grenadillas and palms; merry with mule bells
and songs of the cane-cutters by day, drifted over by fireflies
at night. The volcanic dust, the sun, the terrible climb
amidst the ruins had called up the thirst which is known
only in the desert. He walked scarcely knowing where he
went, casting his eyes from side to side of the way in search
of water. He had forgotten the black beach at Grande
Anse and his desire for the oblivion of the sea; he had
only one immediate desire, to drink.</p>

<p>Thirst in its acutest form like this is quite divorced from
the sensation which civilisation knows as thirst. It is a
passion far stronger than hatred or desire, it affects the soul<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
no less than the body, it drives all other feelings before it
and reigns supreme. The physical pangs are nothing compared
to the mental desire which drives all other desires
away.</p>

<p>As he turned the shoulder of Pelée, the ashes ceased on
the road giving place to volcanic dust, for only St. Pierre
and the western portion of the island had been exposed to
the full blast of the eruption. The road became a road
again, and, had he possessed eyes to see, hope might have
come to him.</p>

<p>For here, where Marie used to pause of a morning to
drink in the view before her, still lay the view as of old.
The volcanic dust that had lain grey on tree and shrub,
had been washed away by rains, and the green waving
canes, the palms, and wild pines, the tamarinds, and ceibas,
the mornes, mountains, and valleys lay stretched before
him; who saw nothing of it all, walking like a somnambulist
in the dream of thirst.</p>

<p>He had passed Morne Rouge where there was no sign of
life, and the Morne d’Avril was showing green, but unseen,
before him when the voice of water, liquid, and laughing,
broke the silence. It was a way-side fountain. Crystal
water spouting from a moss-grown lion-head.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was like drinking life; the mountains in the distance
became mountains again; the wind, the wind; and the sunlight,
the sunlight; the world of shadows and semi-delirium
through which he had been walking, faded away. Like a
good enchantress, the water had washed away the stains of
his journey and the thirst from his soul. In that moment,
just like one convalescing from a severe illness, he felt newborn.
He was seated upon a bank, and above him in the
trade wind waved the huge fronds of ferns, and before him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
lay a field of canes overripe, that had been spared the cane-cutters’
knives.</p>

<p>Half drowsy, still exhausted, but wrapped in the new
feeling of well-being, like a man who is recovering from
an anaesthetic, he noted his surroundings; and, as his eyes
travelled from point to point, they suddenly came to rest
on a spot just before him.</p>

<p>On the dust of the road, sheltered by the bank and the
ferns from the wind, lay the imprint of a naked foot. A
woman’s little foot had pressed the dust of the road but a
short time before; the print was warm to the sight and
living, one could almost see the fleeting figure swiftly moving
as the breeze, and graceful as the bending palm. The
print of the heel was far less marked than that of the fore
part.</p>

<p>The volcanic dust, though gone from the foliage, still lay
upon the road, and on this dust of ruin lay the woman’s
foot mark, vivid, triumphant over death. Gaspard gazed
at it. He glanced at the fountain beside him singing and
laughing beneath the shadow of the ferns, then he remembered.
It was here that he had paused that day with
Marie; it was here that she had given him the ratifia, it was
here—it was here.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, gazed again at the mark in the road
and followed its printing. Farther on he lost it, for the
wind had blown the dust across it; further on he found it,
very faint, but still discernible.</p>

<p>Then, where a little side path broke off from the road,
he found it clearly again.</p>

<p>She had taken the path.</p>

<p>Along the National Road you find many paths like these.
Short cuts to villages, paths used by the cane cutters and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
market folk, often mere traces half smothered by the tropical
grasses.</p>

<p>He followed the path which led towards a wood of ceibas
and angelines, palms with enormous trunks, thick as the
trunks of full grown oak trees; tree ferns and wild pines.</p>

<p>As he came a voice hailed him from the liquid shadow of
the trees, it was the voice of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">siffleur de montagne</i>; clear,
silvery, bell-like, the voice of the bird came through the
silence of the sultry noon. There was no other sound but
the stirring of the palm fronds in the wind.</p>

<p>Here, amidst the trees, by this old forgotten pathway lay
a shrine to the Virgin; one of the thousand shrines that are
found on the roads and pathways of Martinique. As he
pushed the lianas and the air shoots of the wild pine aside,
a voice other than the voice of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">siffleur de montagne</i> met
his ear. The bird had ceased, and through the murmur of
the wind in the trees came this voice; the voice of a woman,
sweeter than the voice of the bird.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Moving silently as a shadow, pushing the leafy veils
aside, scarcely breathing, he reached a point from which
he could see vaguely in the twilight of the trees the shrine
and the woman kneeling before it.</p>

<p>Her voice was clear now, and the soft, childish Creole
words of the votary came to him for whom she was giving
thanks.</p>

<p>No supplicatory prayer was this, but an assured thanksgiving
for the safety of one who had been spared the darkness
and the terror of chaos, the horror of death, the fate
of her ruined world, for one who was safe and who would
return. “At morning, noon, and evening, I have praised
thee on my knees—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
It was the noonday prayer—and it passed devoutly from
a prayer of praise to one of supplication. Supplication for
the souls of the dead and for the living, for Missie Seguin
who had been spared even as she had been spared; for herself,
a creature not deserving the protection that had saved
her, that had led her away to the safety of Grande Anse
when Pelée had spoken and the world had fallen in ruins.</p>

<p>Then she rose to her feet, the white magic of Love and
Faith still like a light upon her face. As her eyes fell upon
the man standing beneath the trees, for one divine second
she paused with breath caught back, spirit like, and ringed
with the twilight as with a charm.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Where the trade wind was blowing and the green waves
breaking on the beach of Grande Anse, welcome and a new
life were waiting for them.</p>

<p>The man he had saved from the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fer de lance</i> had the will
and the power to open the doors of a golden future for them,
yet they could not break from yesterday so soon.</p>

<p>Heedless of time or place they sat by the road-side fountain,
till the shadows were lengthening on the road and
the valleys humming with night. Darkness found them on
the ruined road above the ruined city.</p>

<p>They had come almost unconsciously to look at it again,
to breathe the air of the past through which they had so
miraculously wandered, and, as they stood clasping one
another, gazing through the vagueness at the lights of the
warships in the bay, the sea of a sudden became touched
with silver and the rising moon broke above the shoulder
of Pelée.</p>

<p>The light flooded across the harbour and struck the
shrouded city like a tide. The ruins of the Place Bertine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
came into view; its broken and veiled cathedral, the thread
of darkness outlining the Rue Victor Hugo.</p>

<p>In the moonlight the desolation became robbed of its
terror and all was touched with the poetry of deep antiquity,
from the flooding sea to the forms of the lovers set
far above the ruins.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
